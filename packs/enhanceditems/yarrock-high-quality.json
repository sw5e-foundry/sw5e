At the end of the high, the creature must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or experience a low that lasts 4 hours, during which they must roll a [[/r d8]] and subtract the result when making an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw using Charisma. At the end of the low, the creature must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw to resist addiction.</p>\n<p>Â </p>\n<h2>Yarrock</h2>\n<p>Yarrock is a hallucinogen which is said to instill a creature with a clear vision of \"the meaning of life\", granting a boost to confidence.
