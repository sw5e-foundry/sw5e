      "value": "<h2>Biology and Appearance</h2>\n<p>Trandoshans are a large, bipedal sentient species, with scaly skin which was shed roughly once every standard year and was thought to be very durable. Cold-blooded reptiles, trandoshans had two super-sensitive varied color eyes with horizontal black pupils, which could see far into the infrared range. Each of their four limbs ends in three razor sharp claws. These are perfect for combat, but did not grant them manual dexterity, making a trandoshan's finger movements somewhat clumsy and awkward. </p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Trandoshans worship their goddess, the Scorekeeper, whom they would appease through acts which increased their Jagannath points. This is done by living a lifestyle which was, by non-trandoshan standards, overtly aggressive, leading many trandoshans to become bounty hunters, mercenaries, or slavers. Trandoshans especially prize wookiee pelts, which consequently play a large part in earning Jagannath points-capturing the pelts of particularly infamous wookiees would give the hunter a large increase in Jagganath points. To be shamed or captured during a hunt would zero one's Jagganath points-effectively making their life forfeit in the eyes of the Scorekeeper. They could, however, win all those points back by killing the one who zeroed their score.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Trandoshan names are quite harsh and contain a lot of elongated sounds, as well as a lot of s's. Differences between male and female names are often very subtle, but there is a higher chance for female names to contain softer sounds.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Bossk, Tshyrrng, Varrsk, Wuikkekss</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Aksa, Idwiks, Kluks, Mezuus, Shokss</p>\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> Dallosss, Druc, Groqisch, Hsac, Nausdot</p>",
