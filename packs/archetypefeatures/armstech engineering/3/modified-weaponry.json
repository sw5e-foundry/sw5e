Over the course of a long rest, you can modify the weapon. You must have the weapon and armstech's implements in order to perform this modification.</p>\n<p>Your modified weapon is enhanced, requires attunement, can only be used by you, and counts as a tech focus for your tech powers while you are attuned to it. Your modified weapon has 4 modification slots, and it gains more at higher levels, as shown in the Modification Slots column of the engineer table. For each modification installed in excess of your proficiency bonus, your tech point maximum is reduced by 1. Over the course of a long rest, you can install, replace, or remove a number of modifications up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one).</p>\n<p>Some modification effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your tech save DC.</p>\n<p>At 9th level, you can maintain two modified weapons. Each modified weapon has modification slots as shown in the Modification Slots column of the engineer table.</p>",
