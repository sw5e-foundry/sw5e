      "value": "<p>You produce up to 4 wires, which bind creatures of your choice that you can see within range. A creature can be targeted by more than one wire. </p>\n<p>Each target must make a Dexterity saving throw for each wire that targets it. On a failed save, the creature is restrained and falls prone as it is wrapped securely by the wire.</p>\n<p>A creature restrained by a wire can use its action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (its choice) against your tech save DC. On a success, it is no longer restrained by that wire. A wire can also be destroyed; each one has AC 15 and 10 hit points, and has immunity to all damage not dealt by melee weapons.</p>\n<p>A wire that misses its target or is escaped falls slack and disintegrates, as do all remaining wires when the power ends.</p>",
