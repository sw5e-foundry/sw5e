A single fuel tank holds enough fuel for three attacks in a line or a single attack in a cone. Each creature must make a DC 22 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes [[/r 2d6]] acid damage, and the first attack it makes before the end of its next turn has disadvantage. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and isn't disadvantaged. If this damage reduces a creature to 0 hit points, it must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it dies immediately without making death saving throws. A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing and carrying are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. </p>\n<p>Â </p>\n<h2>Projector tank, corrosive</h2>\n<p>When triggered, this vapor projector ammunition produces a spray of acid in a line 15 feet long and 5 feet wide or a 15-foot cone.
