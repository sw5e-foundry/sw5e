      "value": "<p><span style=\"font-family:'Open Sans', sans-serif\">Your ship is equipped with a weapon designed to disable enemy ships without damaging them through use of a specialized ion cannon that delivers a powerful electromagnetic burst. A crewmember can fire the super-heavy ion cannon at a target as an action, which has a range of 1,000 feet and a limited firing arc, as described in Chapter 9. The target must make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + the crewmember's proficiency bonus + the ship's Strength modifier). On a failed save, a ship is stunned for 1 minute. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:'Open Sans', sans-serif\">As an action on each of the ship's turns, a crewmember can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:'Open Sans', sans-serif\">If a ship is targeted by a ship two or more sizes larger than them, it has disadvantage on the initial saving throw. If targeted by a ship two or more sizes smaller, it instead has advantage.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:'Open Sans', sans-serif\">This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges. If you have more than one Super-Heavy Ion Cannon installed, they all share this amount of uses, and each Super-Heavy Ion Cannon past the first grants an additional use.</span></p>",
