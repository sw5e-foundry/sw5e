      "value": "<p>As an action, a crew member can choose one ship you can see within 600 feet and attempt to remotely override its controls. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw (DC = 8 + prof. bonus + ship's charisma modifier). If the ship is directly piloted by a humanoid that is not incapacitated, it gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to the pilot's Intelligence modifier. If you or ships that are friendly to you are fighting it, it has advantage on the saving throw. On a failed save, the ship is charmed by you for the duration.</p><p>While the ship is charmed, you have a wireless link with it as long as the two of you are within the same system. Via your ship, you can use this link to issue commands to the ship while you are conscious (using a bonus action), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as 'Attack that ship,' 'Move over there,' or 'Fly casual.' If the ship completes the order and doesn't receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.</p><p>You can use your action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the ship takes only the actions you choose, and doesn't do anything that you don't allow it to do. During this time, you can also cause the ship to use a reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction as well.  For every action, bonus action, or reaction you make the ship use, you must spend an equivalent action.</p><p>Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new Intelligence saving throw against the power. If the saving throw succeeds, the power ends.</p><p>This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.</p>",
