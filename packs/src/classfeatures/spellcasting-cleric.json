      "value": "<p>As a conduit for divine power, you can cast cleric powers.</p>\n<h5>At-Wills</h5>\n<p>At 1st level, you know three at-wills of your choice from the cleric power list. You learn additional cleric at-wills of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the At-Wills Known column of the Cleric table.</p>\n<h5>Preparing and Casting Powers</h5>\n<p>The Cleric table shows how many power slots you have to cast your powers of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these powers, you must expend a slot of the power's level or higher. You regain all expended power slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p>You prepare the list of cleric powers that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric power list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric powers equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one power). The powers must be of a level for which you have power slots.</p>\n<p>For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level power slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared powers can include six powers of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level power cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the power doesn't remove it from your list of prepared powers.</p>\n<p>You can change your list of prepared powers when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric powers requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per power level for each power on your list.</p>\n<h5>Powercasting Ability</h5>\n<p>Wisdom is your powercasting ability for your cleric powers. The power of your powers comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric power refers to your powercasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p><strong>Power save DC</strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\n<p><strong>Power attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\n<h5>Ritual Casting</h5>\n<p>You can cast a cleric power as a ritual if that power has the ritual tag and you have the power prepared.</p>\n<h5>Powercasting Focus</h5>\n<p>You can use a holy symbol (see @UUID[Compendium.sw5e.rules.BYFd9hiJGo9L5aOM.JournalEntryPage.AjavRU4yPfI9hfaI]{Adventuring Gear}) as a powercasting focus for your cleric powers.</p>",
