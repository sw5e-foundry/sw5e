      "value": "<p><em><strong>Mounted Specialist:</strong> 7th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level</em></p>\n<p>You learn to fend off strikes directed at you, your mount, or other creatures nearby. If you or a creature you can see within 5 feet of you is dealt damage by an attack, you can roll [[/r 1d8]] as a reaction if you're wielding a melee weapon or a shield. Roll the die, and add the number rolled to the target's AC against that attack. If the attack still hits, the target has resistance against the attack's damage.</p>\n<p>You can use this feature three times. You gain an additional use at 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.</p>",
