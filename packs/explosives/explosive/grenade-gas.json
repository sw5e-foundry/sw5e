      "value": "<p>Grenades can be set to detonate on impact or with a timer that causes them to explode on initiative count 20 (losing all initiative ties). As an action, you can prime and throw a grenade at a point you can see within 30 feet + your Strength modifier x 5. The grenade explodes, filling the air in a 10-foot-radius sphere with yellow-green fog for 1 minute. The fog spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. It lasts for 1 minute or until a wind of at least 10 miles per hour disperses it.</p>\n<p>When a creature enters the fog or starts its turn there, it creature must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. The creature takes [[/r 2d6]] poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Additionally, on a failed save, the creature is poisoned while it is in the cloud. Droids, constructs and humanoids wearing appropriate protective equipment are unaffected.</p>",
