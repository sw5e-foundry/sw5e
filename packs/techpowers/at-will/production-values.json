You can also alter the sound of your voice to achieve a certain effect--to sound more intimidating, for example.</li>\n<li>You cause unenhanced electronic lights to flicker, brighten, dim, or change color for 1 minute.</li>\n<li>You cause harmless tremors in the ground for 1 minute.</li>\n<li>You create a sound within range for up to 1 minute. The sound can range in volume from a whisper to a scream.</li>\n<li>You instantaneously cause an unlocked door or window to fly open or slam shut.</li>\n<li>You alter the appearance of your eyes for 1 minute.</li>\n<li>You create an illusory image of an object no larger than a 5 foot cube. The illusion is purely visual.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you cast this power multiple times, you can have up to three of its 1-minute effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.</p>\n<p>A creature that witnesses the effects of this power can use its action to make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your tech save DC. On a successful check, the creature discerns that the effects are illusory, and they become faint to the creature.</p>\n<p>The maximum number of active effects increases by 3 when you reach 5th level (6), 11th level (9), and 17th level (12).</p>",
