Choose one of the Gunning Mastery options, detailed below. You can select this venture multiple times. You can't take a Gunning Mastery option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</span></p><h4>CANNON MASTERY</h4><p>You are the master of laser cannons. While you are firing a primary weapon, when you take the Fire action, you can choose to fire rapidly at the expense of accuracy. Your attacks are made without the aid of your proficiency bonus, but you use your bonus action to make an additional attack, also without your proficiency bonus.</p><h4>HEAVY GUN MASTERY</h4><p>You are the master of railguns and turbolasers. While you are firing a secondary weapon, before you make an attack, you can choose to double your proficiency bonus. If the attack hits, you reduce the damage dealt by an amount equal to your proficiency bonus.</p><h4>PAYLOAD MASTERY</h4><p>You are the master of missiles, rockets, and other ship-board explosive weapons. While you are firing a tertiary or quaternary weapon, you can choose to reduce the DC by an amount equal to your proficiency bonus. If you do, and the target fails the saving throw, they take additional damage equal to twice your proficiency bonus.</p><p></p>",
