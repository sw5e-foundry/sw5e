      "value": "<p><em>(Requires attunement)</em></p><p>While holding this rod, you can use your reaction to absorb a power that is targeting only you and not with an area of effect. The absorbed power's effect is canceled, and the power's energy not the power itself - is stored in the rod. The energy has the same level as the power when it was cast. The rod can absorb and store up to 50 levels of energy over the course of its existence. Once the rod absorbs 50 levels of energy, it can't absorb more. If you are targeted by a power that the rod can't store, the rod has no effect on that power.</p><p>When you become attuned to the rod, you know how many levels of energy the rod has absorbed over the course of its existence, and how many levels of power energy it currently has stored.</p><p>If you are a powercaster holding the rod, you can convert energy stored in it into power slots to cast powers you have prepared or know. You can create power slots only of a level equal to or lower than your own power slots, up to a maximum of 5th level. You use the stored levels in place of your slots, but otherwise cast the power as normal. For example, you can use 3 levels stored in the rod as a 3rd-level power slot.</p><p>A newly found rod has 1d10 levels of power energy stored in it already. A rod that can no longer absorb power energy and has no energy remaining becomes nonmagical.</p><section class=\"secret foundry-note\" id=\"secret-4moLuVa8eSuTndZO\"><p><strong>Foundry Note</strong></p><p>The rod currently has the maximum 10 charges for a newly found rod. Adjust as required.</p></section>",
