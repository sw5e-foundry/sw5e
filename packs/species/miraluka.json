      "value": "<h2>Biology and Appearance</h2>\n<p>The Miraluka are a near-human species that differs from Humans in that they lack eyes, only retaining vestigial eye sockets, and perceive the environment around them through <em>force sight</em> instead of regular vision. This vision is so strong that if a Miraluka looks upon a Jedi or Sith, they can \"see\" Force radiating off them. The strength of a Miraluka's connection to the Force varies by individual.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Miraluka are a thoughtful, cautious, and deliberative species. They have little interest in personal gain or glory. For social reasons, Miraluka hide their appearance by wearing a headband, a mask, or similar concealing headwear. In addition all Miraluka are very united by species. They call themselves \"brothers\" and are considered as members of a great family. As a Force-using species, Miraluka are often quite shocked if 'shown' life not connected to the Force. </p>\n<p>Many Miraluka worship two gods, Ashla and Bogan, through the philosophy of the Greater Force. They do not believe in good or evil, but were taught to accept both life and death.</p>\n<p>Miraluka Force-sensitives are an order of their own called the Luka Sene. Academic in atmosphere and culture, the Luka Sene focus primarily on developing the sense-related powers of their members. However, unlike the Jedi, Sith and other traditions, the Luka Sene does not dictate a member's personal life.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Miraluka names are generally two syllables. Miraluka don't use surnames, as they believe they are one family.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Aakih, Pafil, Rikhor, Vociif, Xuwuth</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Auchaod, Favom, Mucem, Wilierth</p>",
