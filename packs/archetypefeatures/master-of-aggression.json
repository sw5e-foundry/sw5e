      "value": "<p><em><strong>Ataru Form:</strong> 20th level</em></p>\n<p>Your presence on the field of battle is as a graceful blur of deadly blades and daring acrobatics. Your Dexterity and Wisdom or Charisma scores (your choice) increase by 2. Your maximum for those scores increases by 2. Additionally, you can use your action to gain the following benefits for 1 minute:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You have resistance to kinetic, energy, and ion damage from weapons.</li>\n<li>When an ally within 30 feet of you takes the Attack action, they can make one additional attack as a part of that same action.</li>\n<li>When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can move up to 10 feet. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or die. Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>",
