This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the monk table.</li>\n<li>You can use Dexterity instead of Strength whenever you would make a Strength (Athletics) check to grapple, shove, or trip a creature.</li>\n<li>When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. </li>\n<li>You can take the Dash or Disengage actions as a bonus action.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&gt; ##### Variant: Monks with Lightweapons</p>\n<p>&gt; If monks gain lightweapon proficiency, consider letting them use lightweapons as monk weapons, provided the weapon lacks the dexterity, heavy, special, and two-handed properties.</p>",
