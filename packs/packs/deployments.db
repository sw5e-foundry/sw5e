You can use only one disruption per turn, and you can only use each disruption once per round.</p>\n<p>You learn an additional disruption at 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th rank in this deployment. Each time you learn a new disruption, you can also replace one disruption you know with a different one.</p>\n<h3>Power Dice</h3>\n<p>A power die is expended when you use it. Your ship must have a power die at the required system in order to use the disruption.</p>\n<p>Your ship gains power dice based primarily on reactor production. These power dice are stored in a central and/or system capacitors to power abilities of deployed crew members. Your power die type is determined by your ship tier.</p>\n<h3>Saving Throws</h3>\n<p>Some of your Disruptions require your target to make a saving throw to resist the disruption&rsquo;s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>\n<p><strong>Disruption save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your ship&rsquo;s Charisma modifier</p>\n<h2>Disruptions</h2>\n<p>The collaborations are presented in alphabetical order.</p>\n<h3>Enhance Scopes</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Power Die Location:</strong> Sensors</em><br />As a bonus action, can expend one power die to increase the ranges of your ship&rsquo;s next primary or secondary weapon attack by 500 feet. If it hits, you add the power die to the attack&rsquo;s damage roll.</p>\n<h3>Disarming Shot</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Power Die Location:</strong> Sensors</em><br />As an action, you can expend one power die to attempt to disarm the target. You add the power die to your ship&rsquo;s next attack roll. On a hit, in addition to the normal damage taken, the target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, you disable a weapon of the target ship of your choice until the ship recharges.</p>\n<h3>Hacked Communications</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Power Die Location:</strong> Comms</em><br />As an action, you may expend a power die, and choose any number of ships that you can see within 600 feet of you. Each ship must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take ionic damage equal to the number rolled on the die + your ship&rsquo;s Charisma modifier (minimum of one). Additionally, on a failed save, the ship&rsquo;s communication devices are disabled until rebooted.</p>\n<h3>Reactor Vulnerability</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Power Die Location:</strong> Comms</em><br />When a friendly ship hits a ship with a weapon attack, you can expend a superiority die as a reaction to temporarily destabilize the ship&rsquo;s reactor. Add the number rolled to the damage of the weapon attack and the ship must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be shocked until the end of its next turn.</p>\n<h3>Remote Sensors</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Power Die Location:</strong> Sensors</em><br />Whenever you make a Wisdom (Scan) or an Intelligence (Probe) check, you can employ the aid of remote sensors by expending a power die, adding the number rolled to the check. You can use this maneuver before or after making the ability check, but before the results of the ability check are determined.</p>\n<h3>Sensor Blast</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Power Die Location:</strong> Comms</em><br />When a friendly ship hits a target with a weapon attack, you can expend one power die as a reaction to attempt to saturate the target&rsquo;s sensors. You add the power die to the attack&rsquo;s damage roll, and the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on all attack rolls against targets other than your ship until the end of your next turn.</p>\n<h3>Systems Block</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Power Die Location:</strong> Comms</em><br />When a friendly ship makes an attack roll, you can use your reaction and expend a power die and add it to the attack roll. On a hit, the target&rsquo;s next attack has disadvantage and it cannot regain shield points until the start of your next turn.</p>\n<h3>Targeted Strike</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Power Die Location:</strong> Sensors</em><br />When a friendly ship makes an attack against a target, you can use your reaction to expend a power die. You add the power die to the attack roll, and the damage roll if it hits. You can use this maneuver before or after the attack roll, but before the GM determines whether or not the attack hits.</p>\n<h2>System Disruption</h2>\n<p>At 2nd rank, as a bonus action while deployed as an operator, you can choose a ship that you can see within 1,000 feet and target its systems for disruption. For the next minute, or until you disrupt another target, you have advantage on any Wisdom (Scan) or Intelligence (Probe) check you make to find it.</p>\n<p>Additionally, when the ship makes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, you can use your reaction to disrupt the ship&rsquo;s functions. Roll a System Disruption die, which is a d6, and subtract it from the ability check, attack roll, or saving throw. You can choose to use this feature after the ship makes its roll, but before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. You can use this feature twice. You gain another use of this feature at 3rd, 4th, and 5th rank in this deployment. You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p>Your System Disruption die changes when you reach certain ranks in this deployment. The die becomes a d8 at 3rd rank, a d10 at 4th rank, and a d12 at 5th rank.</p>\n<h2>Improved Interference</h2>\n<p>Also at 2nd rank, when you use take the Interfere action, you have advantage on the Charisma (Interfere) check. If you already have advantage, you can instead reroll one of the dice once.</p>\n<h2>Disrupted Defenses</h2>\n<p>At 3rd rank, the first time the target of your System Disruption takes damage each round, it takes additional damage equal to your System Disruption die. The damage is of the same type dealt by the original attack.</p>\n<h2>Threat Assessment</h2>\n<p>Also at 3rd rank, as a bonus action, you can learn certain information about the capabilities of the target of your System Disruption. The GM tells you if the ship is your ship&rsquo;s equal, superior, or inferior in regard to two of the following characteristics of your choice:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An ability score</li>\n<li>Armor Class</li>\n<li>Current total hull and shield points</li>\n<li>Total ship tiers (if any)</li>\n<li>Total deployment ranks (if any)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Masterful Interference</h2>\n<p>At 4th rank, when you take the Interfere action, you can choose to forgo your proficiency bonus. If you succeed on the check, the target has disadvantage on all ability checks or attack rolls it makes before the start of your next turn, instead of one.</p>\n<h2>Haywire</h2>\n<p>Also at 4th rank, when you target a ship with your System Disruption feature, it must make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + your bonus to Interfere checks). On a failed save, while it is the target of your System Disruption feature, the first time it makes an attack roll or a saving throw each round, the target must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from the attack roll or saving throw.</p>\n<h2>Paragon Operator</h2>\n<p>As of 5th rank, you are a paragon of your deployment. When you would expend a Power die or a System Disruption die, you can use a d4 instead of expending a die. You can only use this feature once per round.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you regain all expended uses of your System Disruption feature when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<p>Lastly, when you would make an Interfere, Scan, or Probe check while deployed as an operator, you can take the maximum instead of rolling. You can use this feature before or after making the roll, but before any effects of the roll are determined. Once you&rsquo;ve used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p>\n<h2>Overload Systems</h2>\n<p>Also at 5th rank, you learn how to overload the systems of a ship remotely. As an action, you can attempt to breach the systems of the target of your System Disruption. The ship must make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + your bonus to Interfere checks). On a failed save, the target&rsquo;s flying speed reduced by half, it&rsquo;s turning speed is doubled, it takes a -2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws, it&rsquo;s shields no longer regenerate, and it can&rsquo;t use reactions. On its turn, it can use either an action or a bonus action, not both. Regardless of the ship&rsquo;s abilities, crew, or equipment, it can&rsquo;t make more than one attack during its turn.</p>\n<p>The ship&rsquo;s pilot makes another Constitution saving throw at the end of its turns. On a successful save, the effect ends.</p>\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p>"}},"folder":"H32p1XK09eJcqL89","sort":400000,"flags":{},"img":"systems/sw5e/packs/Icons/Deployments/Operator.webp","effects":[]}

Many gambits enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one gambit per attack, and you can only use each gambit once per turn.</p>\n<p>You learn an additional gambit at 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th rank in this deployment. Each time you learn a new gambit, you can also replace one gambit you know with a different one.</p>\n<h3>Power Dice</h3>\n<p>A power die is expended when you use it. Your ship must have a power die at the required system in order to use the gambit.</p>\n<p>Your ship gains power dice based primarily on reactor production. These power dice are stored in a central and/or system capacitors to power abilities of deployed crew members. Your power die type is determined by your ship tier.</p>\n<h2>Gambits</h2>\n<p>The gambits are presented in alphabetical order.</p>\n<h3>Crippling Shot</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Power Die Location:</strong> Weapons</em><br />When you hit a ship with a ship attack, you can expend one power die to cripple it. Add the power die to the attack&rsquo;s damage roll, and the target ship&rsquo;s flying speed is reduced by half until the end of their next turn.</p>\n<h3>Disabling Shot</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Power Die Location:</strong> Weapons</em><br />When you make a ship attack roll against a ship, you can expend one power die to add it to the roll. On a hit, the ship has disadvantage on the next ability check or attack roll it makes before the end of your next turn.</p>\n<h3>Distracting Shot</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Power Die Location:</strong> Weapons</em><br />When you hit a ship with a ship attack, you can expend one power die to give your allies an opening. You add the power die to the attack&rsquo;s damage roll, and the next attack roll against the target by someone other than you has advantage if the attack is made before the start of your next turn.</p>\n<h3>Explosive Shot</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Power Die Location:</strong> Weapons</em><br />When you reduce a ship to 0 hit points, you can expend one power die and use a bonus action on your turn to make one additional ship attack against a different ship within range. If that attack hits, add the power die to the attack&rsquo;s damage roll.</p>\n<h3>Expose Weakness</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Power Die Location:</strong> Weapons</em><br />When you hit a ship with a ship attack, you can expend a power die and deal additional damage equal to the number rolled. This damage cannot be reduced in any way.</p>\n<h3>Feinting Shot</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Power Die Location:</strong> Weapons</em><br />You can expend one power die and use a bonus action on your turn to feint, choosing one ship within your primary weapon&rsquo;s normal range as your target. You have advantage on your next attack roll against that ship. If that attack hits, add the power die to the attack&rsquo;s damage roll.</p>\n<h3>Penetrating Shot</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Power Die Location:</strong> Weapons</em><br />When you hit a ship with a ship attack, you can expend one power die to attempt to damage another ship with the same attack. Choose a second ship within 150 feet of and directly behind your initial target. If the original attack roll would hit the second ship, it takes damage equal to the number you roll on your power die. The damage is of the same type dealt by the original attack.</p>\n<h3>Precision Shot</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Power Die Location:</strong> Weapons</em><br />When you make a ship attack roll against a ship, you can expend one power die to add it to the roll. If that attack hits, add the power die to the attack&rsquo;s damage roll. You can use this power before or after making the attack roll, but before any effects of the attack are applied.</p>\n<h2>Gunning Style</h2>\n<p>At 2nd rank, you adopt a particular style of gunning as your specialty. Choose one of the Gunning Style options, detailed in Chapter 6. You can&rsquo;t take a Gunning Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p>\n<h2>Improved Critical</h2>\n<p>Also at 2nd rank, your critical hit range with primary and secondary weapons increases by 1, and when a ship rolls a 1 on a saving throw against a tertiary or quaternary weapon that you control, they treat the effect&rsquo;s damage as if it had rolled the maximum.</p>\n<h2>Dependable Gunner</h2>\n<p>Starting at 3rd rank, when you roll for damage with a ship weapon, you can reroll one of the dice, but you must use the new result. You may use this feature a number of times equal to your ranks in gunner. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.</p>\n<h2>Brutal Critical</h2>\n<p>Also at 3rd rank, you can roll the weapon damage dice one additional time when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a ship weapon.</p>\n<h2>Gunning Mastery</h2>\n<p>At 4th rank, you master a particular style of gunning. Choose one of the Gunning Mastery options, detailed in Chapter 6. You can&rsquo;t take a Gunning Mastery option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p>\n<h2>Protean Gunner</h2>\n<p>Also at 4th rank, you can choose a second Gunning Style option.</p>\n<h2>Paragon Gunner</h2>\n<p>At 5th rank, when you would expend a power die, you can use a d4 instead of expending a die. You can only use this feature once per round.</p>\n<p>Additionally, when you make an attack roll while deployed as a gunner, you can choose to make the roll a critical hit. You can use this feature before or after making the roll, but before any effects of the roll are determined. Once you&rsquo;ve used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p>\n<h2>Maximum Power</h2>\n<p>Also at 5th rank, when you hit a ship with a ship attack, you can deal maximum damage with that attack.</p>\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve used this feature, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>"}},"folder":"H32p1XK09eJcqL89","sort":200000,"flags":{},"img":"systems/sw5e/packs/Icons/Deployments/Gunner.webp","effects":[]}

Using your tech die does not expend it.</p>\n<p>Your tech die changes when you reach certain ranks in this deployment. The die becomes a d6 at 2nd rank, a d8 at 3rd rank, a d10 at 4th rank, and a d12 at 5th rank.</p>\n<h3>Creative Thinking</h3>\n<p>If you roll a 1 on your tech die, it decreases by one die size until the end of your next turn. This represents you burning through your creativity. For example, if the die is a d6 and you roll a 1, it becomes a d4. If it&rsquo;s a d4 and you roll a 1, it becomes unusable until the end of your next turn.</p>\n<p>Conversely, if you roll the maximum number on your tech die, it increases by one die size until the end of your next turn, up to a d12. This represents you having a creative break-through. For example, if you roll a 4 on a d4, the die then becomes a d6. If it&rsquo;s a d12 and you roll a 12, on future rolls until the end of your next turn, you can roll an extra die and choose which die to use.</p>\n<h2>Techniques</h2>\n<p>The techniques are presented in alphabetical order.</p>\n<h3>Comms Boost</h3>\n<p>As a bonus action, you can roll a tech die and add it to the next Charisma (Interfere) check your ship makes before the end of your next turn.</p>\n<h3>Engine Tuning</h3>\n<p>As an action, you can roll your tech die. Take the result of the die and multiply it by 50. The flying speed of your ship increases by this amount until the end of your next turn.</p>\n<h3>Power Distribution</h3>\n<p>As a bonus action, you can roll your tech die and move that number of power dice from their current location to another location.</p>\n<h3>Quiet Electronics</h3>\n<p>As a bonus action, you can roll a tech die and add it to the next Dexterity (Stealth) check your ship makes before the end of your next turn.</p>\n<h3>Reactor Boost</h3>\n<p>As an action, you can roll your tech die. Your reactor immediately produces that many power dice that must be stored immediately based on your ship&rsquo;s power coupling. For any power dice produced in excess of your ship&rsquo;s capacity to store, your ship takes that many hull points in damage.</p>\n<p>Additionally, your ship must succeed on a Constitution (Regulation) check (DC = 10 + the number rolled on your tech die) or take hull damage equal to one hull die + your ship&rsquo;s strength modifier.</p>\n<h3>Sensor Boost</h3>\n<p>As a bonus action, you can roll a tech die and add it to the next Wisdom (Scan) or Intelligence (Probe) check your ship makes before the end of your next turn.</p>\n<h3>Shield Reinforcement</h3>\n<p>As a bonus action, you can roll your tech die. Your shields immediately regenerate by the result of the die.</p>\n<h3>Weapon Overload</h3>\n<p>As a bonus action, you can roll your tech die. The next time a ship weapon deals damage before the end of your next turn, it deals additional damage equal to the result of the die. The damage is of the same type dealt by the original attack.</p>\n<h2>Quick Fixer</h2>\n<p>At 2nd rank, when you take the Patch action or conduct ship repairs during recharging, you have advantage on the Constitution (Patch) check. If you already have advantage, you can instead reroll one of the dice once.</p>\n<h2>Ship Mechanic</h2>\n<p>Also at 2nd rank, when installing new equipment or upgrades, you count as two members of a workforce, instead of one.</p>\n<h2>Dependable Tech</h2>\n<p>Starting at 3rd rank, you can regain use of your starting tech die as a reaction. Once you&rsquo;ve used this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p>\n<h2>Reroute Power</h2>\n<p>Also at 3rd rank, as an action on each of your turns, you can reroute power between your ship&rsquo;s engines, shields, and weapons through use of the ship&rsquo;s power coupling. A power coupling can be toggled to neutral, where all three aspects function normally, or can divert power to a specific system.</p>\n<p>When diverting power to a system, the effects of that system are doubled:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Engines:</strong> A ship&rsquo;s flying speed is doubled.</li>\n<li><strong>Shields:</strong> Shields take half damage and shield regeneration rate is doubled.</li>\n<li><strong>Weapons:</strong> Weapons deal double damage.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When diverting power to a system, power to the other systems is halved:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Engines:</strong> A ship&rsquo;s flying speed is reduced by half.</li>\n<li><strong>Shields:</strong> Shields take double damage and shield regeneration rate reduced by half.</li>\n<li><strong>Weapons:</strong> Ship weapon damage is reduced by half.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Rapid Repairman</h2>\n<p>At 4th rank, when you take the Patch action, you can choose to forgo your proficiently equipped bonus. If you succeed on the check, you can expend 2 Hull Dice, instead of one. For each Hull Die spent in this way, roll the die and add the ship&rsquo;s Constitution modifier to it.</p>\n<h2>Efficient Reroute</h2>\n<p>Also at 4th rank, when you reroute power you only halve power to one other system of your choice.</p>\n<h2>Paragon Tech</h2>\n<p>As of 5th tier, you are a paragon of your deployment. When you make a Strength (Boost) check or a Constitution (Regulate) check, you can take the maximum instead of rolling. You can use this feature before or after making the roll, but before any effects of the roll are determined.

You can use only one tactic per turn, and you can only use each tactic once per round.</p>\n<p>You learn an additional tactic at 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th rank in this deployment. Each time you learn a new tactic, you can also replace one tactic you know with a different one.</p>\n<h3>Power Dice</h3>\n<p>A power die is expended when you use it. Your ship must have a power die at the required system in order to use the tactic.</p>\n<p>Your ship gains power dice based primarily on reactor production. These power dice are stored in a central and/or system capacitors to power abilities of deployed crew members. Your power die type is determined by your ship tier.</p>\n<h2>Tactics</h2>\n<p>The tactics are presented in alphabetical order.</p>\n<h3>Attack Pattern Delta</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Power Die Location:</strong> Engines</em><br />When your ship makes a ship attack while there is a friendly ship within 100 feet of you, you can expend a power die to grant advantage to the roll. If the attack hits, add the result of the die to the attack&rsquo;s damage roll.</p>\n<h3>Break the Lock</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Power Die Location:</strong> Engines</em><br />When the ship fails a Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution saving throw, as a reaction, you can expend a power die to attempt to recover. Roll the die and add the result to the saving throw.</p>\n<h3>Defense Screen</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Power Die Location:</strong> Engines</em><br />As a bonus action, you can expend a power die and take a defensive formation as long as there is a friendly ship within 100 feet of you. When you do so, your AC increases by the amount rolled on the die until the start of your next turn.</p>\n<h3>Koiogran Turn</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Power Die Location:</strong> Engines</em><br />When you are the target of an attack roll, you can expend a power die and attempt to maneuver out of the line of fire. Roll the die, take the result, and multiply it by 50. You immediately move that many feet in a direction of your choice. The orientation of your ship does not change.</p>\n<h3>Skim the Surface</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Power Die Location:</strong> Engines</em><br />As a bonus action, you can expend a power die and attempt to fly through the space of a hostile ship. Roll the die, take the result, and multiply it by 50. Your ship&rsquo;s flying speed increases by that amount until the end of your turn. Additionally, moving through a hostile ship&rsquo;s space does not count as hostile terrain this turn.</p>\n<h3>Snap Roll</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Power Die Location:</strong> Engines</em><br />When you are hit by a ship attack, you can expend a power die and attempt to roll to mitigate the damage. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by the amount rolled on the die.</p>\n<h3>Starship Charge</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Power Die Location:</strong> Engines</em><br />When you take the Ram action, you can expend a power die to increase the damage. On a failed save, the target ship takes additional kinetic damage equal to the amount rolled on the die + your ship&rsquo;s Strength modifier. Your ship has resistance to the additional damage dealt by this tactic.</p>\n<h3>Target Acquired</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Power Die Location:</strong> Engines</em><br />As a bonus action, you can expend a power die and hone in on a target you can see. The next attack roll made by your ship has advantage, and if the attack hits, add the result of the die to the attack&rsquo;s damage roll.</p>\n<h2>I&rsquo;ll Try Spinning</h2>\n<p>At 2nd rank, when you use take the Evade action, you can choose to have all attacks against you from a single ship have disadvantage until the beginning of your ship&rsquo;s next turn.</p>\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve used this feature, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n<h2>Uncanny Dodge</h2>\n<p>Also at 2nd rank, when an attacker that you can see hits your ship with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack&rsquo;s damage against your ship.</p>\n<h2>Dependable Pilot</h2>\n<p>Starting at 3rd rank, when you would make a Dexterity (Maneuvering) check while assigned as a pilot, you can take the maximum instead of rolling. You can use this feature before or after making the roll, but before any effects of the roll are determined. You may use this feature a number of times equal to your ranks in piloting. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.</p>\n<h2>Cunning Avoidance</h2>\n<p>Also at 3rd rank, once per round, when your ship is hit with a ship attack or fails a saving throw, you can make a Dexterity (Maneuvering) check, and instead use that value for your AC or saving throw.</p>\n<h2>That&rsquo;s a Good Trick</h2>\n<p>At 4th rank, you can take a reaction to give disadvantage to an attack declared against your ship.</p>\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve used this feature, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n<h2>Evasion</h2>\n<p>Also at 4th rank, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects. When your ship is subjected to an effect, such as a proton torpedo or a seismic charge, that allows your ship to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on a saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.</p>\n<h2>Paragon Pilot</h2>\n<p>As of 5th tier, you are a paragon of your deployment. When you would expend a power die, you can use a d4 instead of expending a die. You can only use this feature once per round.</p>\n<h2>Pilot Extraordinaire</h2>\n<p>Also at 5th rank, you are a master at the helm. As a bonus action, you can harness your experience in a brief but awe-inspiring burst. Until the end of your next turn, you have advantage on Dexterity (Maneuvering) checks, your ship has advantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws, and attack rolls against your ship have disadvantage.</p>\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve used this feature, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>"}},"folder":"H32p1XK09eJcqL89","sort":500000,"flags":{},"img":"systems/sw5e/packs/Icons/Deployments/Pilot.webp","effects":[]}

Until the start of your next turn, your ship has a bonus to dexterity saving throws equal to the amount rolled on the power die.

That ship gains temporary hit points equal to the power die roll + your Charisma modifier.</p>\n<h3>Call for Backup</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Power Die Location:</strong> Comms</em><br />When a ship makes an attack roll against your ship, you can use your reaction and expend a power die and command another willing ally ship within 300 feet of the enemy ship to intercede. A crew member on that allied ship manning a weapon station must use their reaction to do so. The enemy ship is then forced to make an attack on the ally ship instead.

You can only have one uplifting directive roll at a time, and you lose any unused uplifting directive rolls when you complete a short or long rest.</p>\n<h2>Inspiring Display</h2>\n<p>Also at 2nd rank, you can inspire others through stirring words. You spend the next minute rallying your allies by giving an inspiring speech. You grant a number of ships up to your proficiency bonus temporary hull points equal to your Charisma modifier. You also grant to a number of crew members up to your proficiency bonus from those ships one Inspiring Display die, a d6. Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Inspiring Display die, but must decide before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Inspiring Display die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Inspiring Display die at a time.</p>\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve used this feature, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p>Your Inspiring Display die changes when you reach certain ranks in this deployment. The die becomes a d8 at 3rd rank, a d10 at 4th rank, and a d12 at 5th rank.</p>\n<h2>Rallying Cry</h2>\n<p>At 3rd rank, as a bonus action, you can extend a rallying cry to those that can hear you. Choose a number of friendly creatures up to twice your Charisma modifier that can see or hear you. Each of those creatures gains an Inspiring Display die that lasts until the end of your next turn.</p>\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve used this feature, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n<h2>Masterful Directive</h2>\n<p>Also at 3rd rank, when you roll your uplifting directive number as a part of the Direct action, you can use your bonus action to increase your uplifting directive number by an amount equal to your proficiency bonus. If this would increase the value of your uplifting directive number to more than 20, it instead becomes 20.</p>\n<h2>Commanding Presence</h2>\n<p>At 4th rank, you learn a new way to use your Inspiring Display. While aboard your ship, when a creature that can see or hear you fails an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, you can use use your reaction to aid that creature provided it did not already have or use an Inspiring Display die this turn. The creature can then roll the die and add it to the result.</p>\n<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<h2>Contingency Plan</h2>\n<p>Also at 4th rank, while aboard your ship, you can choose two allies, instead of one, when you take the Direct action.</p>\n<h2>Paragon Coordinator</h2>\n<p>As of 5th tier, you are a paragon of your deployment.
