      "value": "<p>As an action, a crew member may scramble the targeting protocols of nearby ships. Each ship in a 300-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within 1200 feet must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + prof. bonus + ship's charisma modifier).  If the ship is directly piloted by a humanoid that is not incapacitated, it gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to the pilot's Intelligence modifier. On a failed save, the target loses the ability to distinguish friend from foe, regarding all creatures it can see as enemies up to a minute, until the ability ends. Each time the target takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.  </p><p>A crew member must use it's bonus action to maintain this ability.</p><p>Whenever the affected ship chooses another target, it must choose the target at random from among the ships it can see within range of the attack, power, or other ability it's using. </p><p>This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.</p>",
