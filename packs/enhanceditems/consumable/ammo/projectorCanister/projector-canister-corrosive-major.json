A single fuel canister holds enough fuel for three attacks in a line or a single attack in a cone. Each creature must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes [[/r 3d6]] acid damage, and the first attack it makes before the end of its next turn has disadvantage.

On a failed save, it dies immediately without making death saving throws. A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing and carrying are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust.
