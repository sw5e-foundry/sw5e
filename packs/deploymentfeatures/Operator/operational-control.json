      "value": "<p>Also at 1st rank, you learn disruptions that are fueled by special dice called power dice.</p><h3>Disruptions</h3><p>You learn two disruptions of your choice, which are detailed under \"Disruptions\" below. You can use only one disruption per turn, and you can only use each disruption once per round.</p><p>You learn an additional disruption at 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th rank in this deployment. Each time you learn a new disruption, you can also replace one disruption you know with a different one.</p><h3>Power Dice</h3><p>A power die is expended when you use it. Your ship must have a power die at the required system in order to use the disruption.</p><p>Your ship gains power dice based primarily on reactor production.  These power dice are stored in a central and/or system capacitors to power abilities of deployed crew members.  Your power die type is determined by your ship tier.</p><h3>Saving Throws</h3><p>Some of your Disruptions require your target to make a saving throw to resist the disruption's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p><p><strong>Disruption save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your ship's Charisma modifier</p>",
