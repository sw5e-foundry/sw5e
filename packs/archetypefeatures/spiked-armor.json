      "value": "<p><em><strong>Armored Approach:</strong> 3rd level</em></p>\n<p>You gain proficiency in armormech's implements. Over the course of a long rest, you can customize a suit of light or medium armor into spiked armor. You must have the armor and armormech's implements in order to perform this modification. You can only have one suit of spiked armor at a time.</p>\n<p>This armor gains the barbed ([[/r 1d4]]) property. If the armor already has the barbed property, the barbed damage increases by one step (from [[/r d4]] to [[/r d6]], or from [[/r d6]] to [[/r d8]]). Additionally, while raging, you add your rage damage bonus to your barbed damage when you successfully initiate or maintain a grapple.</p>\n<p>While wearing your spiked armor, you can use your Constitution modifier instead of your Dexterity modifier when determining your AC.</p>\n<p>Additionally, while wearing your spiked armor, you can use your spiked armor as an improvised weapon. When you do so, you are considered proficient with it, and if your armor's barbed damage would be higher than your damage with improvised weapons, you use the barbed damage instead. If you take the Attack action on your turn and make at least one attack with your spiked armor, you can use your bonus action to make an additional attack with your spiked armor against the same target.</p>",
