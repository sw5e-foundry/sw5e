A single fuel canister holds enough fuel for three attacks in a line or a single attack in a cone. Each creature must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes [[/r 4d4]] cold damage and gains 1 slowed level until the end of your next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and isn't slowed. If this damage reduces a creature to 0 hit points, that creature is frozen in carbonite for 1 hour. If you lack proficiency in the wrist launcher, you must roll the damage dice twice and take the lesser total.</p>\n<p>Â </p>\n<h2>Projector canister, cryo</h2>\n<p>When triggered, this wrist launcher ammunition produces a beam of carbonite energy in a line 15 feet long and 5 feet wide or a 15-foot cone.
