      "value": "<p>As an action, a crew member can dictate a one-word command to a ship you can see within 600 feet. The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw (DC = 8 + prof. bonus + ship's charisma modifier) or follow the command on its next turn. If the ship is directly piloted by a humanoid that is not incapacitated, it gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to the pilot's Intelligence modifier. Some typical commands and their effects follow. You might issue a command other than one described here. If you do so, the GM determines how the target behaves. If the target can't follow your command, the ability ends.</p><p>Approach. The target moves toward you by the shortest and most direct route, ending its turn if it moves within 5 feet of you.</p><p>Deactivate. The target becomes disabled and then ends its turn.</p><p>Flee. The target spends its turn moving away from you by the fastest available means.</p><p>Halt. The target doesn't move and takes no actions. </p><p>This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.</p>",
