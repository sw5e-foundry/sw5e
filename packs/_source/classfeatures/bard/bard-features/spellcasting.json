      "value": "<p>You have learned to untangle and reshape the fabric of reality in harmony with your wishes and music. Your powers are part of your vast repertoire, magic that you can tune to different situations.</p>\n<h5>At-Wills</h5>\n<p>You know two at-wills of your choice from the bard power list. You learn additional bard at-wills of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the At-Wills Known column of the Bard table.</p>\n<h5>Power Slots</h5>\n<p>The Bard table shows how many power slots you have to cast your powers of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these powers, you must expend a slot of the power's level or higher. You regain all expended power slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p>For example, if you know the 1st-level power cure wounds and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level power slot available, you can cast cure wounds using either slot.</p>\n<h5>Powers Known of 1st Level and Higher</h5>\n<p>You know four 1st-level powers of your choice from the bard power list.</p>\n<p>The Powers Known column of the Bard table shows when you learn more bard powers of your choice. Each of these powers must be of a level for which you have power slots, as shown on the table. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new power of 1st or 2nd level.</p>\n<p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the bard powers you know and replace it with another power from the bard power list, which also must be of a level for which you have power slots.</p>\n<h5>Powercasting Ability</h5>\n<p>Charisma is your powercasting ability for your bard powers. Your magic comes from the heart and soul you pour into the performance of your music or oration. You use your Charisma whenever a power refers to your powercasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a bard power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p><strong>Power save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>\n<p><strong>Power attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>\n<h5>Ritual Casting</h5>\n<p>You can cast any bard power you know as a ritual if that power has the ritual tag.</p>\n<h5>Powercasting Focus</h5>\n<p>You can use a musical instrument (see @UUID[Compendium.sw5e.rules.JournalEntry.BYFd9hiJGo9L5aOM.JournalEntryPage.AjavRU4yPfI9hfaI]{Adventuring Gear})) as a powercasting focus for your bard powers.</p>",
