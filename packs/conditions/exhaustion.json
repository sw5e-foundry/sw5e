Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect's description. Exhaustion Level</p>\n<p>|Level|Effect|</p>\n<p>|:--:|:--|</p>\n<p>|1|Disadvantage on ability checks|</p>\n<p>|2|Speed halved|</p>\n<p>|3|Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws|</p>\n<p>|4|Hit point maximum halved|</p>\n<p>|5|Speed reduced to 0|</p>\n<p>|6|Death|</p>\n<p>If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect's description.</p>\n<p>A creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks.</p>\n<p>An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect's description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature's exhaustion level is reduced below 1.</p>\n<p>Finishing a long rest reduces a creature's exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink.</p>"
