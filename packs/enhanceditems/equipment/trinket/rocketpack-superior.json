Activating or deactivating the rocketpack's flight capabilities requires a bonus action and, while active, you have a flying speed of 40 feet. The jetpack last for 1 minute per power cell (to a maximum of 8 minutes) and can be recharged by a power source or replacing the power cells.</p>\n<p>Additionally, your rocketpack comes with an enhanced integrated rocket launcher with the Ammunition (range 100/400) and reload 1 properties. Rather than traditional power cells, this rocket launcher fires specialized projectiles in the form of rockets. Whenever you would make a ranged weapon attack, you can instead fire this rocket launcher. When firing a rocket at long range, creatures within the radius of the rocket's explosion have advantage on the saving throw. Reloading this rocket launcher takes 1 minute.
