      "value": "<h4>Armor (Heavy Exoskeleton)</h4>\n <p>This armor has no weight and does not affect encumbrance. While wearing it, you are considered proficient regardless of whether or not you have proficiency with heavy armor, and you are resistant to all unenhanced damage.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Cursed.</em></strong> You can not remove this armor without first killing the orbalisks. While wearing this armor, whenever you complete a long rest, you must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. You can choose to fail this saving throw. For each saving throw you fail, the size of your Hit Die is reduced by one step (from [[/r d12]] to [[/r d10]], from [[/r d10]] to [[/r d8]], from [[/r d8]] to [[/r d6]], from [[/r d6]] to [[/r d4]], or from [[/r d4]] to [[/r d2]]). If you fail a saving throw while your Hit Die is a [[/r d2]], you die as the orbalisks consume you. Additionally, for each saving throw you fail, your AC increases by 1. For each saving throw you succeed, the size of your Hit Die increases by one step (from [[/r d2]] to [[/r d4]], from [[/r d4]] to [[/r d6]], from [[/r d6]] to [[/r d8]], from [[/r d8]] to [[/r d10]], or from [[/r d10]] to [[/r d12]]). Additionally, for each saving throw you succeed, your AC decreases by 1. The size of your Hit Die can not exceed the Hit Dice granted by your class, and your AC can not be increased or reduced more than the number of Hit Die increases or reductions. </p>\n<p><em>This armor is comprised of a series of small parasitic creatures called orbalisks. Over time, orbalisks reproduce until they cover the entirety of their host.</em></p>\n<p>Â </p>\n<h2>Heavy exoskeleton</h2>\n<h3>Bulky</h3>\n<p>While wearing armor with this property, you have disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks that rely on sound.</p>\n<h3>Strength 17</h3>\n<p>While wearing armor or wielding a shield with this property, your speed is reduced by 10 unless your Strength score meets or exceeds the strength number. </p>\n<hr />\n<p>Heavy exoskeletons are virtually the heaviest armor acquirable during the Galactic War. It is ideal for extreme combat situations that involved direct damage and also offers a very good level of protection in sacrifice of dexterity. Some consider it claustrophobic but that was the trade-off for safety.</p>",
