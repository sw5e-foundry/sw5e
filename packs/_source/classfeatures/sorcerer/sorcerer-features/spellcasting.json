      "value": "<p>An event in your past, or in the life of a parent or ancestor, left an indelible mark on you, infusing you with arcane magic. This font of magic, whatever its origin, fuels your powers.</p>\n<h5>At-Wills</h5>\n<p>At 1st level, you know four at-wills of your choice from the sorcerer power list. You learn additional sorcerer at-wills of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the At-Wills Known column of the Sorcerer table.</p>\n<h5>Power Slots</h5>\n<p>The Sorcerer table shows how many power slots you have to cast your powers of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these sorcerer powers, you must expend a slot of the power's level or higher. You regain all expended power slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p>For example, if you know the 1st-level power burning hands and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level power slot available, you can cast burning hands using either slot.</p>\n<h5>Powers Known of 1st Level and Higher</h5>\n<p>You know two 1st-level powers of your choice from the sorcerer power list.</p>\n<p>The Powers Known column of the Sorcerer table shows when you learn more sorcerer powers of your choice. Each of these powers must be of a level for which you have power slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new power of 1st or 2nd level.</p>\n<p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the sorcerer powers you know and replace it with another power from the sorcerer power list, which also must be of a level for which you have power slots.</p>\n<h5>Powercasting Ability</h5>\n<p>Charisma is your powercasting ability for your sorcerer powers, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will into the world. You use your Charisma whenever a power refers to your powercasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p><strong>Power save DC </strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>\n<p><strong>Power attack modifier </strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>\n<h5>Powercasting Focus</h5>\n<p>You can use an arcane focus as a powercasting focus for your sorcerer powers.</p>",
