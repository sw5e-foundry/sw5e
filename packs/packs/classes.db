Clutching a techblade in each hand, he becomes a whirlwind of steel, cutting down one enemy after another.</p>\n<p>After tumbling away from the shrapnel of a missile's explosion, a bothan finds her feet and quick-fires two shots from her carbine at the oncoming tank. Shrugging off the wave of fear that threatens to permeate her entire being, she strafes around her foe, firing shot after shot to try to penetrate the tank's thick armor.</p>\n<p>Glancing at his wristpad, a sullustan looks through the eyes of his tracker droid. Transmitting instructions, he sends his droid to distract the houk he's been tracking while he readies his sniper rifle for the shot.</p>\n<p>Scouts are the first on the trail and the last to lose it, tracking their quarry for miles unimpeded. They are adaptable, wielding both tech powers and their weaponry to overcome their foes.</p>\n<h2>Deadly Hunters</h2>\n<p>Warriors in their own right, scouts specialize in tracking and hunting the monsters that threaten civilization—humanoid raiders, rampaging beasts and monstrosities, terrible Force-wielders, and renegade droids. They learn to track their quarry as a predator does, moving stealthily through any terrain and hiding themselves in brush and rubble. Scouts focus their combat training on techniques that are particularly useful against their specific favored foes.</p>\n<p>Scouts acquire the ability to cast tech powers through utilization of a wristpad. Their powers, like their combat abilities, emphasize speed, stealth, and the hunt. A scout's talents and abilities are honed with deadly focus on the grim task of protecting the civilization.</p>\n<h2>Independent Adventurers</h2>\n<p>Though a scout might make a living as a bounty hunter, a guide, or a tracker, a scout's true calling is to defend civilization from the ravages of monsters and humanoid hordes that press in. In some places, scouts gather in secretive orders, though many scouts are independent almost to a fault, knowing that, when a rancor or a band of pirates attacks, a scout might be the first—and possibly the last—line of defense. This fierce independence makes scouts well suited to adventuring, since they are accustomed to life far from the comforts of a dry bed and a hot bath. Faced with city-bred adventurers who grouse and whine about the hardships of the wild, scouts respond with some mixture of amusement, frustration, and compassion. But they quickly learn that other adventurers who can carry their own weight in a fight against civilization's foes are worth any extra burden. Coddled city folk might not know how to feed themselves or find fresh water in the wild, but they make up for it in other ways.</p>\n<p>As you create your scout character, consider the nature of the training that gave you your particular capabilities. Did you train with a single mentor, tracking together until you mastered the scout's ways? Did you leave your apprenticeship, or was your mentor slain—perhaps by some kind of bestial monstrosity on which you've sworn revenge? Or perhaps you learned your skills as part of a band of mercenaries. </p>\n<p>What's the source of your particular hatred of a certain kind of enemy? Did a monster kill someone you loved or destroy your home village? Or did you see too much of the destruction these monsters cause and commit yourself to reining in their depredations? Is your adventuring career a continuation of your work, or a significant change?</p>\n<p>What made you join up with a band of adventurers? Do you find it challenging to teach new allies the ways of the wild, or do you welcome the relief from solitude that they offer?</p>\n<h3>Quick Build</h3>\n<p>You can make a scout quickly by following these suggestions.

They are always seeking out a new answer to a new question. This often goes hand-in-hand with seeking a life of adventure, to explore new, hidden areas, or accompany those that do. The life of a scholar often times begins in the mundane, as a teacher or sage. Sometimes they serve as doctors, diplomats, or as officers in the military.</p>\n<h2>To Learn, To Know</h2>\n<p>For scholars, mundane life is often too slow. When life becomes stagnant or when an answer cannot be found, the call to adventure rings louder. Scholars will often go to ancient, forgotten, and often dangerous places to find something to quench their thirst for knowledge.</p>\n<p>As you create a scholar, it's important to think of where you gained your knowledge. Did you serve as an apprentice under a master? Did you attend college or other formal education? Perhaps you gained it on your own, searching out and pouring over dusty tomes found in forgotten places. Where did your thirst for knowledge come from? Insatiable curiosity? Always wanting to know the right answer? Or do you have something to prove? Think about what field you wish to pursue and think of what is driving you in that direction.</p>\n<h3>Quick Build</h3>\n<p>You can make a scholar quickly by following these suggestions.

She whirls among them, knocking their blows aside and sending them reeling, until at last she stands alone.</p>\n<p>Taking a deep breath, a zabrak covered in tattoos settles into a battle stance. As the first charging mercenaries reach him, he exhales and a blast of negative energy courses from his hands, engulfing his foes.</p>\n<p>Moving with the silence of the night, a black-clad mirialan steps into a shadow beneath an arch and nimbly climbs to the balcony a stone's throw above her.

Whether channeled as a striking display of combat prowess or a subtler focus of defensive ability and speed, this energy infuses all that a monk does.</p>\n<h2>The Power of Focus</h2>\n<p>Monks make careful study of a mystical energy that most monastic orders call focus. This energy is an element of the power that suffuses the galaxy—specifically, the element that flows through living bodies. Monks harness this energy within themselves to create powerful effects and exceed their bodies' physical capabilities, and some of their special attacks can hinder the flow of focus in their opponents. Using this energy, monks channel uncanny speed and strength into their unarmed strikes. As they gain experience, their martial training and their mastery of focus gives them more power over their bodies and the bodies of their foes.</p>\n<h2>Training and Asceticism</h2>\n<p>Most monks live entirely apart from the surrounding population, secluded from anything that might impede their spiritual progress. Others are sworn to isolation, emerging only to serve as spies or assassins at the command of their leader, a noble patron, or some other power.</p>\n<p>The majority of monks don't shun their neighbors, making frequent visits to nearby towns or villages and exchanging their service for food and other goods. As versatile warriors, monks often end up protecting their neighbors from monsters or brigands.</p>\n<p>For a monk, becoming an adventurer means leaving a structured, communal lifestyle to become a wanderer. This can be a harsh transition, and monks don't undertake it lightly. Those who leave their cloisters take their work seriously, approaching their adventures as personal tests of their physical and spiritual growth. </p>\n<p>As you make your monk character, think about your connection to the monastery where you learned your skills and spent your formative years. Were you an orphan or a child left on the monastery's threshold? Did your parents promise you to the monastery in gratitude for a service performed by the monks? Did you enter this secluded life to hide from a crime you committed? Or did you choose the monastic life for yourself?</p>\n<p>Consider why you left. Did the head of your monastery choose you for a particularly important mission beyond the cloister? Perhaps you were cast out because of some violation of the community's rules. Did you dread leaving, or were you happy to go? Is there something you hope to accomplish outside the monastery? Are you eager to return to your home?</p>\n<p>As a result of the structured life of a monastic community and the discipline required to harness focus, monks are typically lawful in alignment.</p>\n<h3>Quick Build</h3>\n<p>You can make a monk quickly by following these suggestions.

With a roar he charges at the pair of trandoshans who dared poach his kin. </p>\n<p>A gamorrean snarls at the latest challenger to his authority over their savage tribe, ready to break his neck with his bare hands as he did to the last six rivals. </p>\n<p>Frothing at the mouth, a nikto slams his helmet into the face of his foe, then turns to drive his armored elbow into the gut of another.</p>\n<p>These berserkers, different as they might be, are defined by their rage: unbridled, unquenchable, and unthinking fury. More than a mere emotion, their anger is the ferocity of a cornered predator, the unrelenting assault of a storm, the churning turmoil of the sea. For every berserker, rage is a power that fuels not just a battle frenzy but also uncanny reflexes, resilience, and feats of strength.</p>\n<h2>Primal Instinct</h2>\n<p>People of towns and cities take pride in how their civilized ways set them apart from animals, as if denying one's own nature was a mark of superiority. To a berserker, though, civilization is no virtue, but a sign of weakness. The strong embrace their animal nature keen instincts, primal physicality, and ferocious rage. Berserkers are uncomfortable when hedged in by walls and crowds. They thrive where the civilized don't.</p>\n<p>Berserkers come alive in the chaos of combat. They can enter a berserk state where rage takes over, giving them superhuman strength and resilience. A berserker can draw on this reservoir of fury only a few times without resting, but those few rages are usually sufficient to defeat whatever threats arise.</p>\n<h2>A Life of Danger</h2>\n<p>Not every person deemed \"berserkers\" by scions of civilized society has the berserker class. A true berserker among these people is as uncommon as a skilled fighter in a town, and he or she plays a similar role as a protector of the people and a leader in times of war. Life in the wild places of the world is fraught with peril: rival tribes, deadly weather, and terrifying monsters. Berserkers charge headlong into that danger so that their people don't have to.</p>\n<p>Their courage in the face of danger makes berserkers perfectly suited for adventuring. Wandering is often a way of life for their native tribes, and the rootless life of the adventurer is little hardship for a berserker. Some berserkers miss the close-knit family structures of the tribe, but eventually find them replaced by the bonds formed among the members of their adventuring parties.</p>\n<p>When creating a berserker character, think about where your character comes from and his or her place in the world. Talk with your GM about an appropriate origin for your berserker. Did you come from a remote planet, making you a stranger in the area of the campaign? Or is the campaign set in a rough-and-tumble frontier where berserkers are common?</p>\n<p>What led you to take up the adventuring life? Were you lured to settled planets by the promise of riches? Did you join forces with soldiers of those lands to face a shared threat? Did monsters or an invading horde drive you out of your homeland, making you a rootless refugee? Perhaps you were a prisoner of war, brought in chains to \"civilized\" lands and only now able to win your freedom. Or you might have been cast out from your people because of a crime you committed, a taboo you violated, or a coup that removed you from a position of authority.</p>\n<h3>Quick Build</h3>\n<p>You can make a berserker quickly by following these suggestions.
