For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to the Manifestation of Abeloth's Will ability.</li>\n<li>You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, <em>will of the force</em> could undo an opponent's successful save, a foe's critical hit, or a friend's failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples.

This power might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish.

Additionally, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn't 3 or lower already, for [[/r 2d4]] days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Additionally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast <em>will of the force</em> ever again if you suffer this stress. Finally, if you are reduced to 0 hit points as a result of this necrotic damage, or at any point before you have fully recovered from the Strength reduction, you immediately die and cannot be resurrected as your body fades away, absorbed into the living Force.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"requirements":"","source":"PHB","activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":"inst"},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":"self"},"uses":{"value":null,"max":null,"per":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"other","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[["1d10","necrotic"],["2d4",""]],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"power"},"level":9,"school":"lgt","components":{"value":"","vocal":false,"somatic":false,"material":false,"ritual":false,"concentration":false},"materials":{"value":"","consumed":false,"cost":0,"supply":0},"preparation":{"mode":"prepared","prepared":true},"scaling":{"mode":"none","formula":null}},"ownership":{"default":0,"fAkTu7iSmy0slLmX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"sw5e","systemVersion":"2.0.2.2.2.4","coreVersion":"10.288","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1667426102299,"lastModifiedBy":"MO2mq4AAHmz86wzy"}}

The target rationalizes any illogical outcomes from interacting with the hallucination. For example, a target attempting to walk across a phantasmal bridge that spans a chasm falls once it steps onto the bridge. If the target survives the fall, it still believes that the bridge exists and comes up with some other explanation for its fall - it was pushed, it slipped, or a strong wind might have knocked it off.</p>\n<p>An affected target is so convinced of the hallucination's reality that it can even take damage from the illusion. A hallucination created to appear as a creature can attack the target. Similarly, a hallucination created to appear as fire, a pool of acid, or lava can burn the target. Each round on your turn, the hallucination can deal [[/r 1d6]] psychic damage to the target if it is in the hallucination's area or within 5 feet of the hallucination, provided that the illusion is of a creature or hazard that could logically deal damage, such as by attacking. The target perceives the damage as a type appropriate to the illusion.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Force Potency.</em></strong> When you cast this power using a force power slot of 3rd level or higher, the range increases by 20 feet, the image dimensions increase by 5 feet, and you can target one additional creature for every two slot levels above 2nd.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"requirements":"","source":"PHB","activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":"1","units":"minute"},"target":{"value":"10","width":null,"units":"ft","type":"cube"},"range":{"value":"60","long":null,"units":"ft"},"uses":{"value":null,"max":null,"per":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"save","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[["1d6","psychic"]],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"wis","dc":null,"scaling":"power"},"level":2,"school":"drk","components":{"value":"","vocal":false,"somatic":false,"material":false,"ritual":false,"concentration":true},"materials":{"value":"","consumed":false,"cost":0,"supply":0},"preparation":{"mode":"prepared","prepared":true},"scaling":{"mode":"level","formula":null}},"ownership":{"default":0,"fAkTu7iSmy0slLmX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"sw5e","systemVersion":"2.0.2.2.2.4","coreVersion":"10.288","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1667446280874,"lastModifiedBy":"MO2mq4AAHmz86wzy"}}
