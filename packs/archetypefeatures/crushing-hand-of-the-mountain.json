      "value": "<p>As an action, you can choose a 5-foot-square unoccupied space on the ground that you can see within 30 feet. A Medium hand made from soil and stone, which lasts for 1 minute, rises in that space and reaches for one Large or smaller creature you can see within 5 feet of it. The target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes [[/r 2d6]] kinetic damage and is restrained for the duration. As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can cause the hand to crush the restrained target, which must make a Strength saving throw. It takes [[/r 2d6]] kinetic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. To break out, the restrained creature can use its action to make a Strength check against your focus save DC. On a success, the target escapes and is no longer restrained by the hand. As an action, you can cause the hand to reach for a different creature or to move to a different unoccupied space within range. The hand releases a restrained target if you do either.</p>",
