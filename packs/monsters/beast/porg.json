They were native to the planet Ahch-To, where Jedi Master Luke Skywalker made his exile in the years prior to the Battle of Crait.</p><h3>Biology and appearance</h3><p>Porgs were a species of non-sentient birds. They were stocky in nature, with two short wings, flat, beakless faces, and two webbed feet. Porgs were sexually dimorphic; males were slightly larger than females, and males also had orange plumage around the eyes. Porgs of both sexes were covered in dense feathers, with white coloration on the body and face, and gray to brown on the wings and back. They were much lighter than they looked, thanks to a thick outer layer of waterproof feathers with a fluffy underlayer for warmth. They could fly short distances but not far enough to leave their native island. They could also run quite swiftly on the ground and were good at maneuvering into small spaces. The birds had stereoscopic vision; their eyes had brown irises and black pupils. Porgs favored colder environments.</p><p>Porgs apparently understood certain linguistic terms. When they overheard Rey refer to Chewbacca as \"Chewie,\" they mistook it to be the word chewy, leading them to wonder whether Chewbacca would serve as her food.</p><h3>Behavior</h3><blockquote><p><i>\"Puffy, my good luck charm! You look hungry.\"</i></p><p><span style=\"font-size:13px\">- Hondo Ohnaka</span></p></blockquote><p>These hypercurious, cliff-dwelling creatures were found throughout the islands of the planet Ahch-To. They were capable of performing controlled dives into the sea, where they fetched fish to feed on or pass on to their otherwise helpless offspring, which were called \"porglets.\" They also hunted crustaceans. Porgs exhibited a roosting behavior, and they built nests along the island cliffs. They built nests from hair, fiber or grass and decorated them with shiny objects they had acquired. Porgs loved water, both to drink and to play in. They also loved tasting new things. Porgs had strong natural camouflaging abilities, as well as many interesting calls, ranging from burbles to squeaks to song. They crooned a special song when they were pleased. However, they could also be completely silent when necessary. Despite their curious nature, they could be quite shy if they felt threatened. Porgs, both wild and domesticated alike, were unusually smitten by human objects, and found shiny objects very fascinating. If their curiosity ran unchecked, they could wreak havoc. Porgs enjoyed being petted and scratched, especially behind their ears. A group of porgs was called a \"murder.\"</p><h3>History</h3><blockquote><p><i>\"When did this old rattletrap become a birdcage?\"</i></p><p><span style=\"font-size:13px\">- Leia Organa, commenting on the infestation of porgs in the Millennium Falcon</span></p></blockquote><p>Porgs evolved from seabirds on Ahch-To. Considered quite tasty by some species, they were sometimes hunted by the resident Lanai as well as visitors to Ahch-To. At the time of the First Order–Resistance war, when Jedi Master Luke Skywalker threw his lightsaber off a cliff, two porgs investigated the weapon. The birds nearly activated the weapon, before they were scared off by Rey. Shortly afterwards, another porg watched in curiosity from its nest as the Jedi Master spearfished from an island cliff. Rey found the porgs to be helpful to her Jedi training after she used the Force to catch one in midair in order to retrieve the lightsaber it had snatched. Finding that the porg's flock was visibly fascinated by her power, Rey promised them all \"a turn.\" While staying on Ahch-To, the Wookiee Chewbacca roasted two porgs for supper. A few of the birds stared at him before he could take a bite, but Chewbacca scared them off. When Chewbacca landed on Ahch-To, he considered porgs as a tasty treat, but found it hard to kill the winged creatures when the pack turned their sad eyes on him.</p><p>Unable to acquire a patch of blue moss for their young twins, a couple of porgs snatched wiring of the same color from the Millennium Falcon, hindering repairs that were being performed by Chewbacca and R2-D2. Following the porgs to their nest, Chewbacca tried to barter the blue wiring for a blanket but was declined. Soon realizing the plight of the porgs, Chewbacca was convinced by R2 to brave strong winds in order to harvest the moss from the high tree. Grateful for his assistance, the parents returned the wiring to Chewbacca, marking his first amicable relationship with porgs.</p><p>Later, at least four porgs found their way aboard the Millennium Falcon and made a nest. One of them accompanied Chewbacca during the Battle of Crait. Despite having an initial antagonism with the porgs, Chewbacca grew to like them and became their friend.</p><p>Boarding the Millennium Falcon, General Leia Organa observed a number of the creatures roosting aboard the vessel, prompting her to ask Chewbacca when the ship had become a birdcage.</p><p>Among the porgs which resided on the Millennium Falcon were the Porg Stowaway, Puffy and Snappy.</p><p>Around 34 ABY, porgs were imported to the planet Batuu and sold as pets in the Creature Stall at Black Spire Outpost.</p><p>In 35 ABY, a pair of porgs watched as Rey attempted to destroy Kylo Ren's TIE whisper and her lightsaber on Ahch-To.</p>",
