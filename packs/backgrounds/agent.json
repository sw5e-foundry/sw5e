These factions pursue their agendas without regard for political boundaries, and their members operate anywhere the organization deems necessary. These groups employ listeners, rumormongers, smugglers, mercenaries, cache-holders (people who guard caches of wealth or items for use by the faction's operatives), haven keepers, and message drop minders, to name a few. At the core of every faction are those who don't merely fulfill a small function for that organization, but who serve as its hands, head, and heart. As a prelude to your adventuring career (and in preparation for it), you served as an agent of a particular faction. You might have operated openly or secretly, depending on the faction and its goals, as well as how those goals mesh with your own. Becoming an adventurer doesn't necessarily require you to relinquish membership in your faction (though you can choose to do so), and it might enhance your status in the faction.</p>\n\t<p></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"background\">\n\t<p><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> Choose two from Deception, Investigation, Lore, and Persuasion</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"background\">\n\t<p><strong>Languages:</strong> Two of your choice</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"background\">\n\t<p><strong>Equipment:</strong> Badge or emblem of your faction, a copy of a seminal faction text (or a code-book for a covert faction), a set of common clothes, and a pouch containing 150 cr</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"background\"><h2>Feature: Safe Haven</h2></div>\n<div class=\"background\"><p>As a faction agent, you have access to a secret network of supporters and operatives who can provide assistance on your adventures.

These agents never risk their lives for you or risk revealing their true identities.\n</p></div><h2>Background Feat</h2>\n<p>\n\tAs a further embodiment of the experience and training of your background, you can choose from the\n\tfollowing feats:\n</p>\n<div class=\"smalltable\">\n\t<p>\n\t\t</p><table><thead><tr><th>[[/r d8 # Feat]]</th><th>Feat</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class=\"rows\"><th>1</th><th>@Compendium[sw5e.feats.pXakrWdEv2BKYYW8]{Silver-tongued}</th></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><th>2</th><th>@Compendium[sw5e.feats.4O9ON0Km4QZ2ogZu]{Investigator}</th></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><th>3</th><th>@Compendium[sw5e.feats.dzDViHHT3aZ68eTz]{Loremaster}</th></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><th>4</th><th>@Compendium[sw5e.feats.04ClTUSqxi574Xpe]{Charmer}</th></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><th>5</th><th>@Compendium[sw5e.feats.bqcghDqZHiXg1VqF]{Linguist}</th></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><th>6</th><th>@Compendium[sw5e.feats.xJ9X383Z2SHpFSio]{Alert}</th></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><th>7</th><th>@Compendium[sw5e.feats.7diQN6VoqJhyYGtA]{Observant}</th></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><th>8</th><th>@Compendium[sw5e.feats.9omG0nGBGx7taBPS]{Practiced}</th></tr></tbody></table>\n\t<p></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"background\"><h2>Suggested Characteristics</h2></div>\n<div class=\"medtable\">\n\t<p>\n\t\t</p><table><thead><tr><th>[[/r d8 # Personality Trait]]</th><th>Personality Trait</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class=\"rows\"><th>1</th><th>I idolize a particular hero of my faction, and constantly refer to that person's deeds and example.</th></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><th>2</th><th>I can find common ground between the fiercest enemies, empathizing with them and always working towards peace.</th></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><th>3</th><th>I see omens in every event and action.</th></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><th>4</th><th>Nothing can shake my optimistic attitude.</th></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><th>5</th><th>I quote (or misquote) sacred texts and proverbs in almost every situation.</th></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><th>6</th><th>I am tolerant (or intolerant) of other factions and respect (or condemn) them.</th></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><th>7</th><th>I've enjoyed fine food, drink, and high society among my faction's elite.
