For example, you can fabricate a wooden bridge from a clump of trees, a rope from a patch of hemp, and clothes from flax or wool.</p><p>Choose raw materials that you can see within range. You can fabricate a Large or smaller object (contained within a 10-foot cube, or eight connected 5-foot cubes), given a sufficient quantity of raw material. If you are working with metal, stone, or another mineral substance, however, the fabricated object can be no larger than Medium (contained within a single 5-foot cube). The quality of Objects made by the power is commensurate with the quality of the raw materials.</p><p>Creatures or Magic Items can't be created or transmuted by this power. You also can't use it to create items that ordinarily require a high degree of craftsmanship, such as jewelry, Weapons, glass, or armor, unless you have proficiency with the type of artisan's tools used to craft such Objects.</p>",
