Any creature sending incoming or outgoing communications within range must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence (Technology) check. On a failure, their communications are jammed until the comm jammer is deactivated or they move out of its range. The comm jammer lasts for 1 hour and can be recharged by connecting to a power source or by replacing the power cell.</p>",
