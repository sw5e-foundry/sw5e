Your Constitution and Wisdom or Charisma scores (your choice) increase by 2. Your maximum for those scores increases by 2. Additionally, you can use your action to gain the following benefits for 1 minute:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You have resistance to kinetic and energy damage from unenhanced weapons.</li>\n<li>When you use the saber reflect force power, you can make a single melee attack on an enemy within 5ft of you as a part of that same reaction.</li>\n<li>You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws, as do your allies within 30 feet of you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or die. Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>",
