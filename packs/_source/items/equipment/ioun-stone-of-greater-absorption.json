      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, (requires attunement)</em></p>\n<p>An Ioun Stone is named after Ioun, a god of knowledge and prophecy revered on some worlds. Many types of Ioun stone exist, each type a distinct combination of shape and color.</p>\n<p>When you use an action to toss one of these stones into the air, the stone orbits your head at a distance of 1d3 feet and confers a benefit to you. Thereafter, another creature must use an action to grasp or net the stone to separate it from you, either by making a successful attack roll against AC 24 or a successful DC 24 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. You can use an action to seize and stow the stone, ending its effect.</p>\n<p>A stone has AC 24, 10 hit points, and resistance to all damage. It is considered to be an object that is being worn while it orbits your head.</p>\n<p><strong>Stone of Greater Absorption</strong>. While this marbled lavender and green ellipsoid orbits your head, you can use your reaction to cancel a power of 8th level or lower cast by a creature you can see and targeting only you.</p>\n<p>Once the stone has canceled 50 levels of powers, it burns out and turns dull gray, losing its magic. If you are targeted by a power whose level is higher than the number of power levels the stone has left, the stone can't cancel it.</p>",
