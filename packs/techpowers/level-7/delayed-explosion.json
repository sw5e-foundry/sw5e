      "value": "<p>You create a delayed explosion at a point within range. When the power ends, either because your concentration is broken or because you decide to end it, the explosion occurs. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes fire damage equal to the total accumulated damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>\n<p>The power's base damage is [[/r 12d6]]. If at the end of your turn the explosion has not yet occurred, the damage increases by [[/r 1d6]].</p>\n<p>If the explosion is touched before the interval has expired, the creature touching it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the power ends immediately, causing the explosion. </p>\n<p>The fire spreads around corners. It ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Overcharge Tech.</em></strong> When you cast this power using a tech slot of 8th level or higher, the base damage increases by [[/r 1d6]] for each slot level above 7th.</p>",
