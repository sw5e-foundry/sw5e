The target must succeed a Wisdom saving throw against your maneuver save DC. On a failed save, until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn't do anything that you don't allow it to do.</p>\n<p>During this time you can use your reaction to force the creature to use its reaction.</p>\n<p>Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p>",
