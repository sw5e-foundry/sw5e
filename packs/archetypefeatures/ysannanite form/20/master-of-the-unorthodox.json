Your Dexterity and Wisdom or Charisma scores (your choice) increase by 2. Your maximum for these scores increases by 2. Additionally, you can use your action to gain the following benefits for 1 minute:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You have resistance to kinetic, energy, and ion damage from weapons.</li>\n<li>When you hit a creature with a ranged weapon attack, you have advantage on the next melee weapon attack you make against that creature. When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you have advantage on the next ranged weapon attack you make against that creature.</li>\n<li>When you roll below half the maximum on a damage die, you can treat the roll as if you'd rolled half the maximum on the damage die. You can only affect a number of dice up to half your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, rounded up, minimum of one) in this way.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or die. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>",
