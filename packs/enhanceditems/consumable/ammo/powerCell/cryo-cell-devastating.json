Once the cryo cell is depleted, it no longer gives a bonus. Additionally, the loaded weapon deals cold damage instead of its normal damage type, and when you hit with a shot the creature must make a DC 24 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes [[/r 1d8]] cold damage and gains 1 slowed level until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and isn't slowed. If this damage reduces a creature to 0 hit points, that creature is frozen in carbonite for 1 hour.</p>\n<p>Â </p>\n<h2>Cryo cell</h2>\n<p>A cryo cell is a specialized power cell for use with blaster weapons that deal acid, energy, fire, ion, or sonic damage.
