      "value": "<p>As a part of the action used to cast this power, you must make a ranged weapon attack against one creature within your weapon's range, otherwise the power fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects and becomes shocked until the end of your next turn. When this power hits a target, if there is a creature within 30 feet who is shocked, an arc of lightning courses between the two creatures, dealing [[/r 1d6]] lightning damage to both of them. If there are multiple other creatures who are shocked, the lightning leaps to the closest creature.</p>\n<p>The power's damage increases when you reach higher levels. At 5th level, the effects of both the ranged weapon attack and discharge deal an extra [[/r 1d6]] lightning damage. Both damage rolls increase by an additional [[/r 1d6]] at 11th and 17th level.</p>",
