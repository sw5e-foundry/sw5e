      "value": "<p><em><strong>Teras Kasi Order:</strong> 3rd level</em></p>\n<p>Your honed focus allows you to enter a stance of mental fortification and power. You can use your bonus action to enter this stance. When you do so, you unleash a flurry of blows on creatures of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of you. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your bonus to attacks with the weapon) or take the weapon's normal damage.</p>\n<p>This stance lasts for 1 minute. While you are in this stance, you gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Death Weave.</strong> When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points, you gain temporary hit points equal to your focus ability modifier + half your monk level.</li>\n<li><strong>Gundark Slap.</strong> Once on each of your turns, when you hit a creature with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon, you can choose to make it unable to take reactions until the end of your next turn.</li>\n<li><strong>Sleeping Krayt.</strong> You can use your focus ability modifier instead of Strength whenever you would make a Strength check or a Strength saving throw. Additionally, you have advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These effects end early if you are incapacitated or die. Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p>While you have no remaining uses of this feature, you can instead expend 1 focus point to use it. When you do so, your maximum focus points are reduced by 1 until you complete a long rest.</p>",
