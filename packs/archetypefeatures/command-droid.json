      "value": "<p><em><strong>Mechanist Technique:</strong> 15th level</em></p>\n<p>You can reprogram a droid and bring it under your control. As an action, you can touch one droid that you can see that is the target of your Ranger's Quarry. That creature must make a Intelligence saving throw against your tech save DC. If it succeeds, you can't use this feature on it again for 24 hours. If it fails, it becomes friendly to you and obeys your commands until you use this feature again.</p>\n<p>Intelligent droids are harder to control in this way. If the target has an Intelligence of 8 or higher, it has advantage on the saving throw. If it fails the saving throw and has an Intelligence of 12 or higher, it can repeat the saving throw at the end of every hour until it succeeds and breaks free.</p>",
