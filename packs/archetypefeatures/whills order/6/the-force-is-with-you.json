If you reduce the target below one-quarter cover, you ignore cover bonuses entirely. At 17th level, you can spend 3 focus points to ignore total cover, as long as your target is not hidden from you. </li>\n<li>When you hit a creature with a Whills weapon, that creature has disadvantage on opportunity attacks against you until the start of your next turn.</li></ul>",
