{"_id":"1KSGcLL9HvLEkanx","name":"Sentinel","permission":{"default":0,"vXYkFWX6qzvOu2jc":3},"type":"class","data":{"description":{"value":"<p><img style=\"float: right; margin: 5px; border: 0px; height: 400px;\" src=\"systems/sw5e/packs/Icons/Classes/sentinel_01.webp\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"float: left; width: 0.8em; font-size: 300%; line-height: 80%;\">C</span>lad in black robes, the rattataki pulls his hood forward and steps into the shadowy alcove, only to reappear further down the hall. As his quarry walks past, he presses the hilt of his lightsaber to the back of their head, quickly toggling it on-and-off. He is gone before the corpse hits the ground.</p>\n<p>The togruta dashes across the battlefield, doublesaber deflecting blaster shots to the ground. She pulls her wounded padawan to her feet, and guides her away from the warzone.</p>\n<p>Green-bladed lightsaber a blur, the cathar ferociously presses the attack. With each strike, she guides her opponent closer to the ravine&rsquo;s edge. A flurry of blows followed by a quick <em>force push</em> and her foe tumbles over the edge.</p>\n<p>Sentinels are the masters of blending force powers with weapon attacks. They weave the two together so expertly that their foes have trouble predicting them.</p>\n<h2>The Middle of the Road</h2>\n<p>The sentinel uses stealth and subterfuge to accomplish the will of the Force. Where the consular focuses on mastery of the Force and the guardian focuses on the mastery of the lightsaber, the sentinel focuses on merging the two.</p>\n<h2>Solitary Action</h2>\n<p>Sentinels are notoriously independent, most comfortable acting alone and without backup; where some use a team to make up for their weaknesses, the sentinel uses the Force to overcome theirs. While some take this independent streak to the extreme, they are usually accepting of authority, as long as they are allowed to carry out directions using their preferred methods.</p>\n<p>While creating your sentinel, consider your personal philosophy in regards to the Force and its most famous practitioners - the Jedi and the Sith. Are you a member of one of the two orders, or do you walk a different path? Are you an operative tapping into a latent Force-sensitivity? Were you trained in the force from a young age, or did you discover it as an adult? How do you treat those weaker than you? What was your family like? Do you see the Force as light and dark, or an impartial river of gray?</p>\n<h3>Quick Build</h3>\n<p>You can make a sentinel quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Dexterity your highest ability score, followed by Wisdom or Charisma. Second, choose the @Compendium[sw5e.backgrounds.8WMQJLQ6JqRcTZUc]{Jedi} or @Compendium[sw5e.backgrounds.eOpE0XX7z0jx8lwI]{Sith}

class=\"mt-2\">Variant: Starting Wealth</h3>\n<p>In lieu of the equipment granted by your class and background, you can elect to purchase your starting gear. If you do so, you receive no equipment from your class and background, and instead roll for your starting wealth using the criteria below:</p>\n<table style=\"border: 0px; width: 300px;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 150px;\"><strong>Class</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 150px;\"><strong>Funds</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 150px;\">Sentinel</td>\n<td style=\"width: 150px;\">1,000 + 3d4 x 100 cr</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Forcecasting</h2>\n<p>Beginning at 1st level, In your meditations on the force, you have learned powers, fragments of knowledge that imbue you with an abiding force ability. See chapter 10 for the general rules of forcecasting and chapter 11 for the force powers list.</p>\n<h3>Force Powers Known</h3>\n<p>You learn 7 force powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Force Powers Known column of the sentinel class table. You may not learn a force power of a level higher than your Max Power Level, and you may learn a force power at the same time you learn its prerequisite.</p>\n<h3>Force Points</h3>\n<p>You have a number of force points equal to your sentinel level x 3, as shown in the Force Points column of the sentinel class table, + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice). You use these force points to cast force powers. You regain all expended force points when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<h3>Max Power Level</h3>\n<p>Many force powers can be overpowered, consuming more force points to create a greater effect. You can overpower these abilities to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the sentinel class table.</p>\n<p>You may only cast force powers at 5th, 6th, and 7th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.</p>\n<h3>Forcecasting Ability</h3>\n<p>Your forcecasting ability varies based on the alignment of the powers you cast. You use your Wisdom for light side powers, Charisma for dark side powers, and Wisdom or Charisma for universal powers (your choice). You use this ability score modifier whenever a power refers to your forcecasting ability. In addition, you use this ability score modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a force power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p><strong>Force save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your forcecasting ability modifier</p>\n<p><strong>Force attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your forcecasting ability modifier</p>\n<h2>Led by the Force</h2>\n<p>Also at 1st level, you can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any ability check you make that doesn&rsquo;t already include your proficiency bonus.</p>\n<h2>Force-Empowered Self</h2>\n<p>Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the mystical energy of the Force throughout your body. When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1 force point to use a Force-Empowered Self effect. Each effect uses a d4, which changes as you gain sentinel levels, as shown in the Kinetic Combat column of the sentinel table. You have three such effects: Deflection, Double Strike, and Slow Time. You can only use each effect once per turn, and you can only use one effect per hit.</p>\n<h3>Deflection</h3>\n<p>You can roll a Kinetic Combat die and add it to your AC against one attack before the start of your next turn.</p>\n<h3>Double Strike</h3>\n<p>You can roll a Kinetic Combat die and deal additional damage equal to the amount rolled.</p>\n<h3>Slow Time</h3>\n<p>You can roll a Kinetic Combat die to increase your speed by 5 x the amount rolled until the end of your turn.</p>\n<h2>Sentinel Ideals</h2>\n<p>Also at 2nd level, you adopt ideals that exemplify your bond with the Force. You adopt two ideals of your choice, as detailed at the end of the class description. You adopt an additional ideal at 6th and 11th level. When you manifest your Sentinel Ideals, you choose which effect to create.</p>\n<p>You can manifest your ideals twice. You gain an additional use at 9th and 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<h2>Sentinel Calling</h2>\n<p>When you reach 3rd level, you choose a sentinel calling, which is detailed at the end of the class description. Your calling grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 13th, and 18th level.</p>\n<h2>Ability Score Improvement</h2>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can&rsquo;t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Alternatively, you can choose a feat (see Chapter 6 for a list of feats).</p>\n<h2>Extra Attack</h2>\n<p>At 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>\n<h2>Battle Readiness</h2>\n<p>Starting at 10th level, you have fully learned how to meld your physical self with the Force. When you take the Dodge or Disengage actions, or use your action to cast a force power, you can make one melee weapon attack as a bonus action.</p>\n<h2>Enlightened Evasion</h2>\n<p>When you reach 15th level, when you are subjected to a damage-dealing effect that forces you to make a saving throw, you can spend 2 force points to add your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one) to the saving throw if doesn&rsquo;t already include that modifier. If you do so, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail. You can wait until after you roll the d20 to use this feature, but you must decide before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails.</p>\n<h2>Center of the Force</h2>\n<p>At 20th level, you are perfectly centered with the Force. Your Dexterity and Wisdom or Charisma scores (your choice) increase by 2. Your maximum for those scores increases by 2.</p>\n<p>Additionally, once per turn, when you would roll a Kinetic Combat die, you can instead choose the maximum.</p>\n<h2>Sentinel Ideals</h2>\n<p>The ideals are presented in alphabetical order. You can&rsquo;t benefit from a Sentinel Ideal option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p>\n<h3>Ideal of the Agile</h3>\n<p>You gain a swimming speed and a climbing speed equal to your walking speed. When you make a long jump, you can cover a number of feet up to twice your Wisdom or Charisma score (your choice). When you make a high jump, you can leap a number of feet up into the air equal to 3 + twice your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice).</p>\n<p>Additionally, as a bonus action, you can manifest this ideal in a brief surge of energy. For the next minute, opportunity attacks against you are made with disadvantage.</p>\n<h3>Ideal of the Artisan</h3>\n<p>Choose one of your skill or tool proficiencies. When you make an ability check with the chosen skill or tool, you can add half your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one) to any check you make that doesn&rsquo;t already include that modifier.</p>\n<p>Additionally, as an action, you can manifest this ideal in a brief surge of energy. For the next 10 minutes, the bonus increases to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier, and you can choose a second skill or tool to extend this feature to.</p>\n<h3>Ideal of the Contender</h3>\n<p>You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes, and your unarmed strike damage increases by one step (from 1 to d4, d4 to d6, or d6 to d8).</p>\n<p>Additionally, as a bonus action, you can manifest this ideal in a brief surge of energy. For the next minute, your unarmed strikes count as enhanced for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to unenhanced attacks and damage, and you can use your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice) instead of Strength for checks made to grapple a target or escape a grapple.</p>\n<h3>Ideal of the Fighter</h3>\n<p>You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the fighting style options, detailed in Chapter 6. You can&rsquo;t take a fighting style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p>\n<p>Additionally, as a bonus action, you can manifest this ideal in a brief surge of energy. For the next minute, you know the fighting mastery that corresponds with the fighting style you chose with this feature. If you already know that fighting mastery, you instead learn another of your choice for the duration.</p>\n<h3>Ideal of the Hunter</h3>\n<p>You gain darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, this ideal increases its range by 30 feet.</p>\n<p>Additionally, as a bonus action, you can manifest this ideal in a brief surge of energy. For the next minute, you can see normally in enhanced darkness, and you gain blindsight to 10 feet.</p>\n<h3>Ideal of the Steadfast</h3>\n<p>When you would make a melee weapon attack roll, you can instead force the target to make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your bonus to attacks with the weapon). If you would have advantage on your attack roll, the creature instead has disadvantage on their saving throw, and if you would have disadvantage on your attack roll, the creature instead has advantage on their saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes normal weapon damage and is subjected to any additional effects that would occur on a hit.</p>\n<p>Additionally, as a bonus action, you can manifest this ideal in a brief surge of energy. For the next minute, when a creature succeeds on the saving throw, they take half the normal weapon damage, and when a creature rolls a 1 on the saving throw, they treat the damage as if you had rolled the maximum.</p>\n<h3>Ideal of the Titan</h3>\n<p>You gain proficiency in medium armor.</p>\n<p>Additionally, as a bonus action, you can manifest this ideal in a brief surge of energy. For the next minute, you have advantage on ability checks and attack rolls that would forcefully move another creature, and the distance they would be moved increases by 5 feet.</p>\n<h3>Ideal of the Tranquil</h3>\n<p>When you finish a short or long rest, you gain a number of temporary force points equal to half your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (rounded up, your choice, minimum of one).

They can come from any world or region in the galaxy, with origins from the lowliest scoundrel to the once social elite.</p>\n<h2>Evading Danger</h2>\n<p>Operatives have a knack for getting out of trouble. They have an instinct for self-preservation that keeps them alive, but it&rsquo;s usually tempered with a need to experience the thrills that their profession has to offer, and many adventurous operatives are also saddled with a sense of honor that sometimes makes them go against their natural inclinations. No matter what their immediate concerns may be, survival is the name of the game.</p>\n<h2>Outside the Law</h2>\n<p>Operatives don&rsquo;t often start out seeking to defy authority and break the law. Some are thrust into the profession as a means of rebellion. Others wind up on the wrong side of the law due to bad luck, poor decisions, or circumstances beyond their control. The skills they pick up along the way make them great members of any mission team.</p>\n<p>While creating your operative character, consider how you first started on your path. Maybe you were raised on the street and fell into the criminal element as a means of survival. You could be a simple trader who decided to strike against the Sith Empire when it encroached on your business. What would you say is your greatest skill set? What is your core, the truest essence about yourself that keeps you focused? Why would society treat you as a criminal, yet your allies hold you as a loyal companion?</p>\n<h3>Quick Build</h3>\n<p>You can make an operative quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Dexterity your highest ability score, followed by Intelligence or Charisma. Second, choose the @Compendium[sw5e.backgrounds.IgvB3RMSetUpL1l0]{Gambler}

features.</p>\n<h3>Hit Points</h3>\n<p><strong>Hit Dice:</strong> 1d8 per Operative level</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points at 1st Level:</strong> 8 + your Constitution modifier</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong> 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per operative level after 1st</p>\n<h3>Proficiencies</h3>\n<p><strong>Armor:</strong> Light armor</p>\n<p><strong>Weapons:</strong> Simple blasters, simple vibroweapons, blaster pistol, hidden blade, techblade, vibrorapier</p>\n<p><strong>Tools:</strong> One specialist's kit of your choice</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throws:</strong> Dexterity, Intelligence</p>\n<p><strong>Skills:</strong> Choose any four</p>\n<h3>Equipment</h3>\n<p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>(a)</em> a vibrorapier, <em>(b)</em> a hidden blade, <em>(c)</em> a simple blaster and a power cell, or <em>(d)</em> a simple vibroweapon</li>\n<li><em>(a)</em> a simple blaster and two power cells or <em>(b)</em> a simple vibroweapon and a light physical shield</li>\n<li><em>(a)</em> a burglar&rsquo;s pack, <em>(b)</em> a dungeoneer&rsquo;s pack, or <em>(c)</em> an explorer&rsquo;s pack</li>\n<li>A tool with which you are proficient</li>\n<li>Combat suit and a vibrodagger</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"mt-2\">Variant: Starting Wealth</h3>\n<p>In lieu of the equipment granted by your class and background, you can elect to purchase your starting gear. If you do so, you receive no equipment from your class and background, and instead roll for your starting wealth using the criteria below:</p>\n<table style=\"border: 0px; width: 300px;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 150px;\"><strong>Class</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 150px;\"><strong class=\"text-right\">Funds</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 150px;\">Operative</td>\n<td style=\"width: 150px;\">7d4 x 100 cr</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Expertise</h2>\n<p>Beginning at 1st level, choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of your skill proficiencies and one of your tool proficiencies, or two of your tool proficiencies. You gain expertise in those skills or tools.</p>\n<p>At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills or tools) to gain this benefit.</p>\n<h2>Sneak Attack</h2>\n<p>Also at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe's distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.</p>\n<p>You don't need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn't incapacitated, and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll.</p>\n<p>The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the operative class table.</p>\n<h2>Cunning Action</h2>\n<p>At 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.</p>\n<h2>Operative Exploits</h2>\n<p>Also at 2nd level, you&rsquo;ve adopted two exploits, as detailed at the end of the class description. You adopt an additional exploit at 7th, 13th, and 17th level.</p>\n<h2>Bad Feeling</h2>\n<p>Starting at 3rd level, you have a wary eye, bordering on paranoia. When you roll for initiative, you can move up to your speed. This movement happens before the initiative order is determined.</p>\n<p>Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n<h2>Operative Practice</h2>\n<p>Also at 3rd level, you choose a practice that you emulate in the exercise of your operative abilities, which is detailed at the end of the class description. Your practice choice grants you features at 3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.</p>\n<h2>Ability Score Improvement</h2>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Alternatively, you can choose a feat (see Chapter 6 for a list of feats).</p>\n<h2>Uncanny Dodge</h2>\n<p>Starting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack's damage against you.</p>\n<h2>Evasion</h2>\n<p>Beginning at 7th level, when you are subjected to an effect, such as a consular's <em>force storm</em> or an engineer's <em>explosion</em>, that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on a saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.</p>\n<h2>Reliable Talent</h2>\n<p>By 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.</p>\n<h2>Blindsense</h2>\n<p>Starting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the location of any hidden or invisible creature within 10 feet of you.</p>\n<h2>Slippery Mind</h2>\n<p>By 15th level, you have acquired greater mental strength. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws.</p>\n<h2>Elusive</h2>\n<p>Beginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren't incapacitated.</p>\n<h2>Stroke of Luck</h2>\n<p>At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. Your Dexterity and Intelligence scores increase by 2. Your maximum for those scores increases by 2. Additionally, if your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.</p>\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve used this feature, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<h2>Operative Exploits</h2>\n<p>The exploits are presented in alphabetical order. If an exploit has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn it. You can learn an exploit at the same time you meet its prerequisites.</p>\n<h3>Commander&rsquo;s Exploit</h3>\n<p>You gain proficiency in medium armor.</p>\n<h3>Explorer&rsquo;s Exploit</h3>\n<p>You can hold your breath twice as long as you are normally able to, and take half as much damage from fall damage.</p>\n<h3>Fate&rsquo;s Exploit</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 7th level</em><br />When you finish a short or long rest, roll a d20 and record the number rolled. Once before your next short or long rest, you can replace any attack roll, saving throw, or ability check made by you or a creature within 5 feet of you with this roll. You must choose to do so before the roll.</p>\n<h3>Fighter&rsquo;s Exploit</h3>\n<p>You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the fighting Style options, detailed in Chapter 6. You can&rsquo;t take a fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p>\n<h3>Freedom&rsquo;s Exploit</h3>\n<p>You ignore unenhanced difficult terrain, and when you would use your action to break free of an effect that is grappling or restraining you, you can instead use your bonus action.</p>\n<h3>Guerrilla&rsquo;s Exploit</h3>\n<p>You only need 4 hours of sleep to gain the benefit of a long rest.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you have advantage on saving throws against exhaustion.</p>\n<h3>Learner&rsquo;s Exploit</h3>\n<p>You gain proficiency in a skill and a tool, or two tools.</p>\n<p>You can select this discovery multiple times, each time choosing a new skill and a tool, or two new tools.</p>\n<h3>Mentor&rsquo;s Exploit</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 13th level</em><br />Once per turn, whenever both you and a friendly creature within 60 feet that can see and hear you both have to make a saving throw to resist the same effect, you can choose to have disadvantage on the save. If you do so, the friendly creature gains advantage on the save. You can use this feature before or after you both make the saving throw, but you must do so before the GM says whether the save succeeds or fails.</p>\n<h3>Skill&rsquo;s Exploit</h3>\n<p>You learn an exploit that enhances your ability to apply your knowledge to combat situations. You can take this exploit multiple times.</p>\n<p>When you take the Attack action, you can use one of your skill exploits granted by this feature. You can use these features a combined number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p>Choose from the following. You must be proficient in the skill in order to take that skill&rsquo;s exploit.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Aim (Stealth).</em></strong> You attempt to line up a strike against a creature you can see that you are hidden from. Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check contested by the target&rsquo;s Wisdom (Perception) check. If your check succeeds, you gain a +10 bonus to the first attack roll you make against the target before the end of your next turn. If your check fails, you are no longer hidden from the target.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Angle (Perception).</em></strong> You attempt to predict the behavior of a humanoid you can see within 30 feet. Make a Wisdom (Perception) check contested by the target&rsquo;s Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. If your check succeeds, the first attack roll the target makes before the start of your next turn has disadvantage, and the first saving throw the creature makes before the start of your next turn has disadvantage. If your check fails, you can&rsquo;t use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Battle Cry (Intimidation).</em></strong> You attempt to demoralize one humanoid you can see within 30 feet of you that can see and hear you. Make a Charisma (Intimidation) check contested by the target&rsquo;s Wisdom (Insight) check. If your check succeeds, the target is frightened until the end of your next turn. If the target was already frightened of you, it must immediately drop whatever it is holding. On its next turn, if it is still frightened of you, it must take the Dash action and move away from you by the safest available route on its turn, unless there is nowhere to move. If your check fails, you can&rsquo;t use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Charm (Persuasion).</em></strong> You attempt to convince one humanoid you can see within 30 feet that can hear and understand you. Make a Charisma (Persuasion) check contested by the target&rsquo;s Wisdom (Insight) check. If you have dealt damage to the creature in the last hour, it has advantage on the check. If your check succeeds, the target is charmed by you until the start of your next turn, and it has disadvantage on the first attack roll it makes against a creature before the end of its next turn. If your check fails, you can&rsquo;t use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Confuse Beast (Animal Handling).</em></strong> You attempt to confuse one beast on the battlefield. Make a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check contested by the target&rsquo;s Wisdom (Insight) check. If your check succeeds, the beast cannot take actions or reactions until the end of your next turn. If your check fails, you can&rsquo;t use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Distract (Performance).</em></strong> You attempt to distract one beast or humanoid you can see within 30 feet of you that can see and hear you. Make a Charisma (Performance) check contested by the target&rsquo;s Wisdom (Insight) check. If your check succeeds, the next attack roll made against the target before the start of its next turn has advantage. If your check fails, you can&rsquo;t use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Emulate Predator (Nature).</em></strong> You attempt to emulate the sounds of a natural predator of a beast or plant you can see within 30 feet. Make an Intelligence (Nature) check contested by the target&rsquo;s Wisdom (Insight) check. If your check succeeds, the target must take the Dash action and move away from you by the safest available route on its turn, unless there is nowhere to move. If your check fails, you can&rsquo;t use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Feint (Deception).</em></strong> You attempt to divert the attention of a target you can see within 30 feet. Make a Charisma (Deception) check contested by the target&rsquo;s Wisdom (Insight) check. If your check succeeds, the first attack roll made against the target before the start of your next turn by someone other than you has advantage, and the target has disadvantage on the first saving throw they make against an effect caused by a creature other than you before the start of your next turn. If your check fails, the target can&rsquo;t be deceived by you in this way for 1 hour.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Hacktivate (Technology).</em></strong> You attempt to determine the weaknesses in a droid you can see within 30 feet. Make an Intelligence (Technology) check contested by the target&rsquo;s Intelligence (Technology) check. If your check succeeds, you have advantage on the next attack roll you make against the target before the end of your turn, and if you hit, you deal additional damage equal to your Intelligence modifier. If your check fails, you can&rsquo;t use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Instruct (Investigation).</em></strong> You attempt to find a weakness in your target. Make an Intelligence (Investigation) check contested by the target&rsquo;s Charisma (Deception) check. If your check succeeds, if a friendly creature makes an attack roll against the target and they can see and hear you, you can use your reaction to grant them advantage on the roll. If you do so, and they hit, they deal additional damage equal to your bonus to Investigation checks. This damage is the same type as the attack&rsquo;s damage. If your check fails, you can&rsquo;t use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Intuit (Insight).</em></strong> You attempt to determine the motivations of one humanoid you can see within 30 feet. Make a Wisdom (Insight) check contested by the target&rsquo;s Charisma (Deception) check. If your check succeeds, the target can&rsquo;t have advantage on ability checks, attack rolls, or saving throws against you until the end of your next turn. If your check fails, the target instead can&rsquo;t have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, or saving throws against you until the end of your next turn.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Tumble (Acrobatics).</em></strong> You attempt to make a quick tumble, immediately moving 10 feet. If you begin or end this movement within a creature&rsquo;s reach, make a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by it&rsquo;s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If your check succeeds, this movement does not provoke opportunity attacks from it, and you have advantage on the first attack roll you make against it before the end of your turn. If your check fails, you immediately fall prone.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Pocket Sand (Sleight of Hand).</em></strong> You attempt to blind one beast or humanoid you can see within 15 feet of you. Make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check contested by the target&rsquo;s Wisdom (Perception) check. If your check succeeds, the target is blinded until the end of your turn. If your check fails, you can&rsquo;t use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Precision Strike (Medicine).</em></strong> You attempt to strike a pressure point in one humanoid within your reach. Make a Wisdom (Medicine) check contested by the target&rsquo;s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If your check succeeds, they are incapacitated until the end of their next turn. If your check fails, you can&rsquo;t use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Snare (Survival).</em></strong> You attempt to cause a creature within 30 feet of you to stumble. Make a Wisdom (Survival) check contested by the target&rsquo;s Wisdom (Perception) check. If your check succeeds, and the target moves towards you before the start of your next turn, it gains 1 slowed level, and you can use your reaction to cause it to fall prone. If your check fails, you can&rsquo;t use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Spin (Piloting).</em></strong> You attempt to confound a piloted construct you can see within 30 feet. Make an Intelligence (Piloting) check contested by the target&rsquo;s Intelligence (Piloting) check. If your check succeeds, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls against you, and you have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against the target, until the start of your next turn. If your check fails, the target instead has advantage on attack rolls against you, and you have disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws against the target, until the start of your next turn.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Study (Lore).</em></strong> You attempt to anticipate your target&rsquo;s action. Make an Intelligence (Lore) check contested by the target&rsquo;s Charisma (Deception) check. If your check succeeds, you have advantage on the first ability check, attack roll or saving throw you make against that creature before the end of your next turn. Alternatively, before the end of your next turn, you can use your reaction to grant disadvantage on the first ability check, attack roll, or saving throw the target makes against you. If your check fails, you instead have disadvantage on the first ability check, attack roll or saving throw you make against that creature before the end of your next turn.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Wrestle (Athletics).</em></strong> You attempt to grab and pin a creature within 5 feet of you with at least one free hand. The target must be no more than one size larger than you. Make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target&rsquo;s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If your check succeeds, the target is both grappled and restrained by you. If the target stops being grappled, it also stops being restrained. If your check fails, you can&rsquo;t use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.</p>\n<h3>Technologist&rsquo;s Exploit</h3>\n<p>Choose one 1st-level tech power. You learn that power and can cast it at its lowest level without expending tech points and without the use of a wristpad. Once you cast it in this way, you must finish a long rest before you can cast it again. Your techcasting ability for this power is Intelligence.</p>\n<p>You can select this exploit multiple times. Each time you do so, you must choose a different power.</p>\n<h3>Weaponmaster&rsquo;s Exploit</h3>\n<p>You gain proficiency in three blasters or vibroweapons that lack the heavy and strength properties.</p>\n<p>You can select this exploit multiple times.

Clutching a techblade in each hand, he becomes a whirlwind of steel, cutting down one enemy after another.</p>\n<p>After tumbling away from the shrapnel of a missile&rsquo;s explosion, a bothan finds her feet and quick-fires two shots from her carbine at the oncoming tank. Shrugging off the wave of fear that threatens to permeate her entire being, she strafes around her foe, firing shot after shot to try to penetrate the tank&rsquo;s thick armor.</p>\n<p>Glancing at his wristpad, a sullustan looks through the eyes of his tracker droid. Transmitting instructions, he sends his droid to distract the houk he&rsquo;s been tracking while he readies his sniper rifle for the shot.</p>\n<p>Scouts are the first on the trail and the last to lose it, tracking their quarry for miles unimpeded. They are adaptable, wielding both tech powers and their weaponry to overcome their foes.</p>\n<h2>Deadly Hunters</h2>\n<p>Warriors in their own right, scouts specialize in tracking and hunting the monsters that threaten civilization&mdash;humanoid raiders, rampaging beasts and monstrosities, terrible Force-wielders, and renegade droids. They learn to track their quarry as a predator does, moving stealthily through any terrain and hiding themselves in brush and rubble. Scouts focus their combat training on techniques that are particularly useful against their specific favored foes.</p>\n<p>Scouts acquire the ability to cast tech powers through utilization of a wristpad. Their powers, like their combat abilities, emphasize speed, stealth, and the hunt. A scout&rsquo;s talents and abilities are honed with deadly focus on the grim task of protecting the civilization.</p>\n<h2>Independent Adventurers</h2>\n<p>Though a scout might make a living as a bounty hunter, a guide, or a tracker, a scout&rsquo;s true calling is to defend civilization from the ravages of monsters and humanoid hordes that press in. In some places, scouts gather in secretive orders, though many scouts are independent almost to a fault, knowing that, when a rancor or a band of pirates attacks, a scout might be the first&mdash;and possibly the last&mdash;line of defense. This fierce independence makes scouts well suited to adventuring, since they are accustomed to life far from the comforts of a dry bed and a hot bath. Faced with city-bred adventurers who grouse and whine about the hardships of the wild, scouts respond with some mixture of amusement, frustration, and compassion. But they quickly learn that other adventurers who can carry their own weight in a fight against civilization&rsquo;s foes are worth any extra burden. Coddled city folk might not know how to feed themselves or find fresh water in the wild, but they make up for it in other ways.</p>\n<p>As you create your scout character, consider the nature of the training that gave you your particular capabilities. Did you train with a single mentor, tracking together until you mastered the scout's ways? Did you leave your apprenticeship, or was your mentor slain-perhaps by some kind of bestial monstrosity on which you've sworn revenge? Or perhaps you learned your skills as part of a band of mercenaries. What's the source of your particular hatred of a certain kind of enemy? Did a monster kill someone you loved or destroy your home village? Or did you see too much of the destruction these monsters cause and commit yourself to reining in their depredations? Is your adventuring career a continuation of your work, or a significant change? What made you join up with a band of adventurers? Do you find it challenging to teach new allies the ways of the wild, or do you welcome the relief from solitude that they offer?</p>\n<h3>Quick Build</h3>\n<p>You can make a scout quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Strength or Dexterity your highest ability modifier, depending on whether you want to focus on melee combat or on ranged weapons (or finesse weapons). Your next-highest score should be Intelligence. Second, choose the @Compendium[sw5e.backgrounds.wjFDb34eLfyjff1k]{Bounty Hunter}

You use these tech points to cast tech powers. You regain all expended tech points when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<h3>Max Power Level</h3>\n<p>Many tech powers can be overcharged, consuming more tech points to create a greater effect. You can overcharge these powers to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the scout class table.</p>\n<p>You may only cast tech powers at 4th and 5th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.</p>\n<h3>Techcasting Ability</h3>\n<p>Intelligence is your techcasting ability for your tech powers. You use your Intelligence whenever a power refers to your techcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a tech power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p><strong>Tech save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus +your Intelligence modifier</p>\n<p><strong>Tech attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus +your Intelligence modifier</p>\n<h3>Techcasting Focus</h3>\n<p>You use a wristpad (found in chapter 5) as a techcasting focus for your tech powers.</p>\n<h2>Fighting Style</h2>\n<p>Also at 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the Fighting Style options, detailed in Chapter 6. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p>\n<h2>Scout Routine</h2>\n<p>Beginning at 3rd level, you&rsquo;ve developed one routine, as detailed at the end of the class description. You develop an additional routine at 7th and 15th level.</p>\n<h2>Scout Technique</h2>\n<p>Also at 3rd level, you choose to focus on a specific scout technique, which is detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th level.</p>\n<h2>Ability Score Improvement</h2>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Alternatively, you can choose a feat (see Chapter 6 for a list of feats).</p>\n<h2>Extra Attack</h2>\n<p>Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>\n<h2>Expertise</h2>\n<p>At 6th level, choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of skill proficiencies and one of your tool proficiencies, or two of your tool proficiencies. You gain expertise in those skills or tools.</p>\n<p>At 14th level, you can choose another two proficiencies (in skills or tools) to gain this benefit.</p>\n<h2>Commando</h2>\n<p>Starting at 10th level, you can take the Dash and Hide actions as a bonus action on each of your turns. Additionally, you can remain perfectly still for long periods of time to set up ambushes.</p>\n<p>When you attempt to hide on your turn, you can opt to not move on that turn. If you avoid moving, creatures that attempt to detect you take a -10 penalty to their Wisdom (Perception) checks until the start of your next turn. You lose this benefit if you move or fall prone, either voluntarily or because of some external effect. You are still automatically detected if any effect or action causes you to no longer be hidden.</p>\n<p>If you are still hidden on your next turn, you can continue to remain motionless and gain this benefit until you are detected.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you can no longer be tracked by unenhanced means, unless you choose to leave a trail.</p>\n<h2>Combat Tech</h2>\n<p>At 14th level, when you use your action to cast a tech power, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.</p>\n<h2>Supreme Awareness</h2>\n<p>At 18th level, you gain preternatural senses that help you fight creatures you can't see. When you attack a creature you can't see, your inability to see it doesn't impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it.</p>\n<p>You are also aware of the location of any invisible creature within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature isn't hidden from you and you aren't blinded or deafened.</p>\n<h2>Foe Slayer</h2>\n<p>At 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter. Your Strength or Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Intelligence score increases by 2. Your maximum for those scores increases by 2.</p>\n<p>Additionally, once on each of your turns, you can add your Intelligence modifier to the attack roll or the damage roll of an attack you make. You can choose to use this feature before or after the roll but before any effects of the roll are applied.</p>\n<h2>Scout Routines</h2>\n<p>The routines are presented in alphabetical order. If multiple scouts grant the same routine, affected creatures can only benefit from it once. You must be conscious to grant the benefit of your routines.</p>\n<p>At 9th level, the range of your routines increases to 15 feet, and at 17th level, the range of these routines increases to 30 feet.</p>\n<h3>Adaptability Routine</h3>\n<p>At the start of each of your turns, you can choose an ability score with a saving throw in which you are not proficient. Until the start of your next turn, you add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to saving throws you make with the chosen ability. Alternatively, you can choose to extend this benefit to friendly creatures within 5 feet of you, except for you.</p>\n<h3>Maven&rsquo;s Routine</h3>\n<p>At the start of each of your turns, you can choose to gain resistance to damage from tech powers until the start of your next turn. Alternatively, you can choose to extend this benefit to friendly creatures within 5 feet of you, except for you.</p>\n<h3>Mesmer&rsquo;s Routine</h3>\n<p>At the start of each of your turns, you can choose to have advantage on saving throws against effects that would incapacitate you or put you to sleep until the start of your next turn. Alternatively, you can choose to extend this benefit to friendly creatures within 5 feet of you, except for you.</p>\n<h3>Nomad&rsquo;s Routine</h3>\n<p>At the start of each of your turns, you can choose to gain advantage on Constitution saving throws to avoid exhaustion from unenhanced sources, as well as being naturally adapted to both hot and cold climates. Alternatively, you can choose to extend this benefit to friendly creatures within 5 feet of you, except for you.</p>\n<h3>Responder&rsquo;s Routine</h3>\n<p>When you roll initiative, you can choose to add your proficiency bonus to the initiative roll and have advantage on attack rolls against creatures that have not yet acted. Alternatively, you can choose to allow each creature within 5 feet of you, including you, to add half your proficiency bonus to the initiative roll and have advantage on the first attack roll they make against a creature that has not yet acted.</p>\n<h3>Sharpshooter&rsquo;s Routine</h3>\n<p>At the start of each of your turns, you can choose to gain a bonus to the first weapon attack roll you make before the start of your next turn equal to your Intelligence modifier. Alternatively, you can choose to allow each creature within 5 feet of you, including you, to add half your Intelligence modifier to the first weapon attack roll they make before the start of your next turn.</p>\n<h3>Strider&rsquo;s Routine</h3>\n<p>At the start of each of your turns, you can choose to have each slowed level only reduce your speed by 5 feet, unless it would reduce your speed to 0 until the start of your next turn. Alternatively, you can choose to extend this benefit to friendly creatures within 5 feet of you, except for you.</p>\n<h3>Warden&rsquo;s Routine</h3>\n<p>At the start of each of your turns, you can choose to gain a climbing and swimming speed equal to your walking speed. Alternatively, you can choose to extend this benefit to friendly creatures within 5 feet of you, except for you.</p>"},"className":{"value":"Scout"},"atFlavorText":{"value":"<h1>Scout Techniques</h1>\n<p>Scouts tend to share knowledge amongst themselves, focusing on specific techniques and honing them to perfection.

Lightning sparks from his fingers, illuminating his red and black tattoos. The rodian&rsquo;s pleas for mercy fall on deaf ears as the Sith channels his lightning into his failed apprentice, leaving nothing but a charred husk behind.</p>\n<p>Sitting cross-legged on a dense patch of grass, a miraluka mystic meditates on the Force. With every breath, the trees sway with a rhythmic breeze. Though she lacks simple vision, she can see the Force as it moves everything around her.</p>\n<p>A drably-robed human focuses inward, channeling the Force into the ground around him. Slowly, all the debris within arms reach rises into the air around him; with a flick of his wrist, he clears the air, sending his projectiles to pound on the approaching tank.</p>\n<p>Consulars are the supreme wielders of the Force, defined and united by the powers they cast. Drawing on the omnipresent Force that permeates the universe, consulars cast powers of rejuvenating healing and destructive lightning, draining life-force and manipulating minds; the most powerful with the Force can even experience brief glimpses of the future.</p>\n<h2>Strong with the Force</h2>\n<p>Refraining from drawing their lightsabers except as a measure of last resort, consulars spend a great deal of time studying the mysteries of the Force. Their knowledge allows them to channel the Force to greater heights, unlocking unrivaled power, and twisting those powers to greater effect.</p>\n<h2>Sage or Sorcerer</h2>\n<p>Consulars who follow the light side of the Force, using their powers to better their communities and people, are often called sages, while consulars who fall to the dark side and subjugate or cast aside all in their path are commonly called sorcerers. Alternatively, they may tend toward the middle, refraining from politics and war, spending their time in isolation and study.</p>\n<p>While creating your consular, consider your personal philosophy in regards to the Force and its most famous practitioners - the Jedi and the Sith. Are you a member of one of the two orders, or do you walk a different path? Perhaps you were ostracized from your primitive village out of superstition or jealousy. You may have been brutally trained from a young age in the dark side, fueling your innate thirst for power, or perhaps you were trained as a padawan in one of the Jedi temples. How do you treat strangers, and how do they treat you once they know your abilities? What was your family like, or what did you have instead of a family? Do you see the Force as light and dark, or an impartial river of gray?</p>\n<h3>Quick Build</h3>\n<p>You can make a consular quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Wisdom or Charisma your highest ability score, followed by Dexterity. Second, choose the @Compendium[sw5e.backgrounds.8WMQJLQ6JqRcTZUc]{Jedi} or @Compendium[sw5e.backgrounds.eOpE0XX7z0jx8lwI]{Sith}

<em>(b)</em> an explorer&rsquo;s pack, or <em>&copy;</em> a diplomat&rsquo;s pack</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"mt-2\">Variant: Starting Wealth</h3>\n<p>In lieu of the equipment granted by your class and background, you can elect to purchase your starting gear. If you do so, you receive no equipment from your class and background, and instead roll for your starting wealth using the criteria below:</p>\n<table style=\"border: 0px; width: 300px;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 150px;\"><strong>Class</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 150px;\"><strong>Funds</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 150px;\">Consular</td>\n<td style=\"width: 150px;\">5d4 x 100 cr</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Forcecasting</h2>\n<p>In your meditations on the force, you have learned powers, fragments of knowledge that imbue you with an abiding force ability. See chapter 10 for the general rules of forcecasting and chapter 11 for the force powers list.</p>\n<h3>Force Powers Known</h3>\n<p>You learn 8 force powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Force Powers Known column of the consular class table. You may not learn a force power of a level higher than your Max Power Level, and you may learn a force power at the same time you learn its prerequisite.</p>\n<h3>Force Points</h3>\n<p>You have a number of force points equal to your consular level x 4, as shown in the Force Points column of the consular class table, + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice). You use these force points to cast force powers. You regain all expended force points when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<h3>Max Power Level</h3>\n<p>Many force powers can be overpowered, consuming more force points to create a greater effect. You can overpower these abilities to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the consular class table.</p>\n<p>You may only cast force powers at 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.</p>\n<h3>Forcecasting Ability</h3>\n<p>Your forcecasting ability varies based on the alignment of the powers you cast. You use your Wisdom for light side powers, Charisma for dark side powers, and Wisdom or Charisma for universal powers (your choice). You use this ability score modifier whenever a power refers to your forcecasting ability. In addition, you use this ability score modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a force power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p><strong>Force save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your forcecasting ability modifier</p>\n<p><strong>Force attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your forcecasting ability modifier</p>\n<h2>Force Recovery</h2>\n<p>Also at 1st level, you have learned to regain some of your energy by briefly meditating. When you finish a short rest, you can regain a number of force points equal to half your consular level (rounded down) + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one). Once you&rsquo;ve used this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.</p>\n<h2>Force-Empowered Casting</h2>\n<p>At 2nd level, you gain the ability to twist your powers to suit your needs. When you cast a force power, you can expend additional force points to modify the power. You gain two of the following Empowerment options of your choice. You gain another one at 10th and 17th level.</p>\n<p>You can use only one Empowerment option on a power when you cast it, unless otherwise noted.</p>\n<h3>Careful Power</h3>\n<p>When you cast a power that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the power&rsquo;s full force. To do so, you spend 1 additional force point and choose a number of those creatures up to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the power.</p>\n<h3>Distant Power</h3>\n<p>When you cast a power that has a range of 5 feet or greater, you can spend 1 additional force point to double the range of the power.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, when you cast a power that has a range of touch, you can spend 1 additional force point to make the range of the power 30 feet.</p>\n<h3>Extended Power</h3>\n<p>When you cast a power that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can spend 1 additional force point to double its duration, to a maximum duration of 24 hours.</p>\n<h3>Heightened Power</h3>\n<p>When you cast a power that forces a creature to make a saving throw to resist its effects, you can spend 3 additional force points to give one target of the power disadvantage on its first saving throw made against the power.</p>\n<h3>Improved Power</h3>\n<p>When you roll damage for a power, you can spend 1 additional force point to reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one). You must use the new rolls.</p>\n<p>You can use Improved Power even if you have already used a different Empowerment option during the casting of the power.</p>\n<h3>Lingering Power</h3>\n<p>When you cast a power that requires concentration to maintain you can choose to spend 3 additional force points. If you do, when you lose concentration on the power, the power will not end until the end of your next turn.</p>\n<h3>Pinpoint Power</h3>\n<p>When you cast a power that allows you to force creatures in an area to make a saving throw you can instead spend 1 force point and make a ranged force attack against a single target that would be in the range. On a hit the target suffers the effects as though they failed their saving throw.</p>\n<h3>Quickened Power</h3>\n<p>When you cast a power that has a casting time of 1 action, you can spend 2 additional force points to change the casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting.</p>\n<h3>Refocused Power</h3>\n<p>When you are forced to make a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a power you can use your reaction and spend 2 force points to automatically succeed on the saving throw.</p>\n<p>You can use Refocused Power even if you have already used a different Force-Empowered Casting option during the casting of the power.</p>\n<h3>Seeking Power</h3>\n<p>If you miss with a force power that calls for an attack roll, you can spend 2 force points to reroll the attack. You must use the new roll.</p>\n<p>You can use Seeking Power even if you have already used a different Force-Empowered Casting option during the casting of the power.</p>\n<h3>Twinned Power</h3>\n<p>When you cast a power that targets only one creature and doesn&rsquo;t have a range of self, you can spend a number of additional force points equal to the power&rsquo;s level to target a second creature in range with the same power (1 force point if the power is at-will).</p>\n<h2>Force Shield</h2>\n<p>Also at 2nd level, you learn how to defend yourself purely through your strength with the Force. When you are hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to shroud yourself in Force energy. Until the start of your next turn, you have a bonus to AC equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, a minimum of +1). This includes the triggering attack.</p>\n<p>You can use this feature twice. You gain an additional use at 5th, 11th, and 17th level in this class. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<h2>Force Affinity</h2>\n<p>When you reach 3rd level, you've developed an affinity for one of the three aspects of the Force: the Ashla, the Bendu, or the Bogan. Choose one from the following:</p>\n<h3>Ashla</h3>\n<p>When you successfully cast a light side power, either your or the target's (your choice) hit point maximum and current hit points increase by an amount equal to the power&rsquo;s level. This effect lasts for 1 minute. You can only have one instance of this effect active at a time.</p>\n<h3>Bendu</h3>\n<p>You can add both your Wisdom and Charisma modifier to your maximum number of force points, instead of just one.</p>\n<h3>Bogan</h3>\n<p>When you roll a 1 on a damage die for a dark side power, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1.</p>\n<h2>Consular Tradition</h2>\n<p>When you reach 3rd level, you choose a consular tradition, which is detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level.</p>\n<h2>Hidden Force</h2>\n<p>Also at 3rd level, you learn how to conceal the casting of your force powers. When you cast a force power, you can choose to conceal the presence of that casting from others. A creature that sees you cast the force power can make an Investigation (Intelligence) check against your universal force save DC. On a success, they can determine that you used the Force in some way. If a creature has the <em>force sight</em> force power active, they automatically succeed on this check. A creature that can not see you automatically fails this check.</p>\n<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<h2>Ability Score Improvement</h2>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can&rsquo;t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Alternatively, you can choose a feat (see Chapter 6 for a list of feats).</p>\n<h2>One with the Force</h2>\n<p>At 20th level, your attunement to the Force is absolute. Your Wisdom or Charisma score increases by 4, and your maximum for this score increases by 4. Additionally, you gain mastery over a single force power, and can cast it with little effort. Choose one 3rd-level force power that you know as your signature power. You can cast it once at 3rd level without expending force points. When you do so, you can&rsquo;t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<p>If you want to cast it at a higher level, you must expend force points as normal.</p>"},"className":{"value":"Consular"},"atFlavorText":{"value":"<h1>Consular Traditions</h1>\n<p>Different consulars select different traditions, called Ways, to follow as they hone their powers.

With a roar he charges at the pair of trandoshans who dared poach his kin.</p>\n<p>A gamorrean snarls at the latest challenger to his authority over their savage tribe, ready to break his neck with his bare hands as he did to the last six rivals.</p>\n<p>Frothing at the mouth, a nikto slams his helmet into the face of his foe, then turns to drive his armored elbow into the gut of another.</p>\n<p>These berserkers, different as they might be, are defined by their rage: unbridled, unquenchable, and unthinking fury. More than a mere emotion, their anger is the ferocity of a cornered predator, the unrelenting assault of a storm, the churning turmoil of the sea. For every berserker, rage is a power that fuels not just a battle frenzy but also uncanny reflexes, resilience, and feats of strength.</p>\n<h2>Primal Instinct</h2>\n<p>People of towns and cities take pride in how their civilized ways set them apart from animals, as if denying one's own nature was a mark of superiority. To a berserker, though, civilization is no virtue, but a sign of weakness. The strong embrace their animal nature, keen instincts, primal physicality, and ferocious rage. Berserkers are uncomfortable when hedged in by walls and crowds. They thrive where the civilized don't.</p>\n<p>Berserkers come alive in the chaos of combat. They can enter a berserk state where rage takes over, giving them superhuman strength and resilience. A berserker can draw on this reservoir of fury only a few times without resting, but those few rages are usually sufficient to defeat whatever threats arise.</p>\n<h2>A Life of Danger</h2>\n<p>Not every person deemed \"berserker\" by scions of civilized society has the berserker class. A true berserker among these people is as uncommon as a skilled fighter in a town, and he or she plays a similar role as a protector of the people and a leader in times of war. Life in the wild places of the world is fraught with peril: rival tribes, deadly weather, and terrifying monsters. Berserkers charge headlong into that danger so that their people don't have to.</p>\n<p>Their courage in the face of danger makes berserkers perfectly suited for adventuring. Wandering is often a way of life for their native tribes, and the rootless life of the adventurer is little hardship for a berserker. Some berserkers miss the close-knit family structures of the tribe, but eventually find them replaced by the bonds formed among the members of their adventuring parties.</p>\n<h2>Creating a Berzerker</h2>\n<p>When creating a berserker character, think about where your character comes from and his or her place in the world. Talk with your GM about an appropriate origin for your berserker. Did you come from a remote planet, making you a stranger in the area of the campaign? Or is the campaign set in a rough-and-tumble frontier where berserkers are common?</p>\n<p>What led you to take up the adventuring life? Were you lured to settled planets by the promise of riches? Did you join forces with soldiers of those lands to face a shared threat? Did monsters or an invading horde drive you out of your homeland, making you a rootless refugee? Perhaps you were a prisoner of war, brought in chains to \"civilized\" lands and only now able to win your freedom. Or you might have been cast out from your people because of a crime you committed, a taboo you violated, or a coup that removed you from a position of authority?</p>\n<h3>Quick Build</h3>\n<p>You can make a berserker quickly by following these suggestions. First, put your highest ability score in Strength, followed by Constitution. Second, choose the @Compendium[sw5e.backgrounds.1auJD75qZvgEEUdq]{Mercenary} background.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"levelsTable":{"value":"<table class=\"table text-center LevelTable_levelTable_14CWn\"><thead><tr><th align=\"center\">Level</th><th align=\"center\">Proficiency Bonus</th><th align=\"center\">Features</th><th align=\"center\">Rages</th><th align=\"center\">Rage Damage</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class=\"rows\"><td align=\"center\">1st</td><td align=\"center\">+2</td><td align=\"center\">Rage, Unarmored Defense</td><td align=\"center\">2</td><td align=\"center\">+2</td></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><td align=\"center\">2nd</td><td align=\"center\">+2</td><td align=\"center\">Reckless Attack, Danger Sense</td><td align=\"center\">2</td><td align=\"center\">+2</td></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><td align=\"center\">3rd</td><td align=\"center\">+2</td><td align=\"center\">Berserker Approach</td><td align=\"center\">3</td><td align=\"center\">+2</td></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><td align=\"center\">4th</td><td align=\"center\">+2</td><td align=\"center\">Ability Score Improvement</td><td align=\"center\">3</td><td align=\"center\">+2</td></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><td align=\"center\">5th</td><td align=\"center\">+3</td><td align=\"center\">Extra Attack, Fast Movement</td><td align=\"center\">3</td><td align=\"center\">+2</td></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><td align=\"center\">6th</td><td align=\"center\">+3</td><td align=\"center\">Path feature</td><td align=\"center\">4</td><td align=\"center\">+2</td></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><td align=\"center\">7th</td><td align=\"center\">+3</td><td align=\"center\">Feral Instinct</td><td align=\"center\">4</td><td align=\"center\">+2</td></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><td align=\"center\">8th</td><td align=\"center\">+3</td><td align=\"center\">Ability Score Improvement</td><td align=\"center\">4</td><td align=\"center\">+2</td></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><td align=\"center\">9th</td><td align=\"center\">+4</td><td align=\"center\">Brutal Critical (1 die)</td><td align=\"center\">4</td><td align=\"center\">+3</td></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><td align=\"center\">10th</td><td align=\"center\">+4</td><td align=\"center\">Path Feature</td><td align=\"center\">4</td><td align=\"center\">+3</td></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><td align=\"center\">11th</td><td align=\"center\">+4</td><td align=\"center\">Relentless Rage</td><td align=\"center\">4</td><td align=\"center\">+3</td></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><td align=\"center\">12th</td><td align=\"center\">+4</td><td align=\"center\">Ability Score Improvement</td><td align=\"center\">5</td><td align=\"center\">+3</td></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><td align=\"center\">13th</td><td align=\"center\">+5</td><td align=\"center\">Brutal Critical (2 dice)</td><td align=\"center\">5</td><td align=\"center\">+3</td></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><td align=\"center\">14th</td><td align=\"center\">+5</td><td align=\"center\">Path Feature</td><td align=\"center\">5</td><td align=\"center\">+3</td></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><td align=\"center\">15th</td><td align=\"center\">+5</td><td align=\"center\">Persistent Rage</td><td align=\"center\">5</td><td align=\"center\">+3</td></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><td align=\"center\">16th</td><td align=\"center\">+5</td><td align=\"center\">Ability Score Improvement</td><td align=\"center\">5</td><td align=\"center\">+4</td></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><td align=\"center\">17th</td><td align=\"center\">+6</td><td align=\"center\">Brutal Critical (3 dice)</td><td align=\"center\">6</td><td align=\"center\">+4</td></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><td align=\"center\">18th</td><td align=\"center\">+6</td><td align=\"center\">Indomitable Might</td><td align=\"center\">6</td><td align=\"center\">+4</td></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><td align=\"center\">19th</td><td align=\"center\">+6</td><td align=\"center\">Ability Score Improvement</td><td align=\"center\">6</td><td align=\"center\">+4</td></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><td align=\"center\">20th</td><td align=\"center\">+6</td><td align=\"center\">Primal Champion</td><td align=\"center\">Unlimited</td><td align=\"center\">+4</td></tr></tbody></table>"},"source":"PHB","levels":1,"archetype":"","hitDice":"d12","hitDiceUsed":0,"skills":{"number":2,"choices":[],"value":[]},"spellcasting":"none","attributes":{"spelldc":10},"damage":{"parts":[]},"powercasting":"none","armorproperties":{"parts":[]},"weaponproperties":{"parts":[]},"archetypes":{"value":"<div id=\"augmentedapproach\"><span style=\"color: #c40f0f; font-family: Russo One; font-size: 20px;\"><strong>AUGMENTED APPROACH</strong></span><p></p>\n<p>The Augmented Approach is for those who seek to increase their prowess through cybernetic enhancement. Some who take this path go so far they are left with little more than the memory of the body they once owned, all to achieve in combat what they cannot with a body made of flesh and bone.</p>\n<h2>Basic Cybernetics</h2>\n<p>When you choose this approach at 3rd level, you learn the <em>mending</em> and <em>analyse</em> tech powers and can cast them without the use of a wristpad or spending tech points. You can cast <em>analyse</em> this way a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of one). You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.</p>\n<h2>Overdrive Enhancement</h2>\n<p>Also at 3rd level, you gain a cybernetic enhancement. Choose one of the following enhancements and gain its feature. You must undergo cybernetic surgery by a person proficient in biotech's tools that incorporates this enhancement into your body. This surgery costs 100 credits and takes 8 hours.</p>\n<h3>Dermal Armor</h3>\n<p>While raging you have resistance to all damage except psychic damage.</p>\n<h3>Morbid Protrusions</h3>\n<p>While raging, your unarmed strike deals 1d4 + Strength modifier kinetic damage and when you take the Attack action and attack with a melee weapon or unarmed strike, you can use a bonus action to make an unarmed attack. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis unarmed attack die increases to 1d6 at 5th level, 1d8 at 11th level, and 1d10 at 17th level.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Pressurised Limbs\\r\\nWhile raging, you can use your bonus action to leap up to 30 feet to an empty space you can see. When you land you deal kinetic damage equal to your Strength modifier to each creature within 5 feet of where you land. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Consitution modifier (minimum of one). You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Twitchlock Actuators\\r\\nWhile you're raging, other creatures have disadvantage on opportunity attack rolls against you, you can also use the Dash action as a bonus action on your turn.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Support Enhancement\\r\\nAt 6th level you gain an additional cybernetic enhancement. Choose one of the following enhancements and gain its feature. You must undergo cybernetic surgery by a person proficient in biotech's tools that incorporates this enhancement into your body. This surgery costs 600 credits and takes 8 hours.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Body Sculpting\\r\\nYou gain proficiency in two skills of your choice from Athletics, Acrobatics, Stealth, and Sleight of Hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Holdout Cavity\\r\\nYou have a shielded compartment built into your body that can be used to store and hide a light weapon or item of similar size.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Krykna Anchors\\r\\nYou gain a climbing speed equal to your movement speed.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Panspectral Optics\\r\\nYou can see up to 1 mile away with no difficulty. You are able to discern even fine details as though looking at something no more than 100 feet away from you. Additionally, dim light doesn't impose disadvantage on your Wisdom (Perception) checks.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Support Structure\\r\\nYour carrying capacity (including maximum load and maximum lift) is doubled and you have advantage on Strength checks made to push, pull, lift, or break objects.\\r\\n\\r\\n### More Machine than Man\\r\\nStarting at 10th level, your cybernetics allow you to become immune to poison and disease. Additionally, you ignore unenhanced difficult terrain.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Final Enhancement\\r\\nAt 14th level you gain a final cybernetic enhancement. Choose one of the following enhancements and gain its feature. You must undergo cybernetic surgery by a person proficient in biotech's tools that incorporates this enhancement into your body. This surgery costs 2000 credits and takes 8 hours.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Holoskin Emitters\\r\\nWhile you're raging any creature within 5 feet of you that's hostile to you has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you or another character with this feature. An enemy is immune to this effect if it can't see or hear you or if it can't be frightened.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Hydraulic Overrides\\r\\nWhile you're raging you can use a bonus action on your turn to knock a Large or smaller creature prone when you hit it with melee weapon attack.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Integrated Boosters\\r\\nWhile raging you have a flying speed equal to your current walking speed. This benefit works only in short bursts; you fall if you end your turn in the air and nothing else is holding you aloft.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Ysalamir Capacitor Mesh\\r\\nWhen you are forced to make a saving throw against a force power, you can immediately use your reaction to move up to half your speed towards the source power's caster.

On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action, if you aren't wearing heavy armor.</p>\n<p>While raging, you gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.</li>\n<li>When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a berserker, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Berserker table.</li>\n<li>You have resistance to kinetic and energy damage.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you are able to cast powers, you can't cast them or concentrate on them while raging.</p>\n<p>Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious, you don heavy armor, or if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature or taken damage since your last turn. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.</p>\n<p>You can enter a rage a number of times as shown for your berserker level in the Rages column of the berserker table. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.</p>\n<h2>Unarmored Defense</h2>\n<p>Also at 1st level, while you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.</p>\n<h2>Reckless Attack</h2>\n<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.</p>\n<h2>Berserker Instincts</h2>\n<p>Also at 2nd level, you've honed two instincts, as detailed at the end of the class description. You hone an additional instinct at 7th, 13th, and 17th level.</p>\n<h2>Danger Sense</h2>\n<p>At 3rd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren't as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger.</p>\n<p>You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and powers. To gain this benefit, you can't be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated.</p>\n<h2>Berserker Approach</h2>\n<p>Also at 3rd level, you choose an approach that shapes the nature of your rage which is detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels.</p>\n<h2>Ability Score Improvement</h2>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Alternatively, you can choose a feat (see Chapter 6 for a list of feats).</p>\n<h2>Extra Attack</h2>\n<p>Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>\n<h2>Feral Impulse</h2>\n<p>By 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on initiative rolls.</p>\n<p>Additionally, if you are surprised at the start of combat and aren't incapacitated, you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before doing anything else on that turn.</p>\n<h2>Brutal Critical</h2>\n<p>Beginning at 9th level, you can roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.</p>\n<p>This increases to two additional dice at 13th level and three additional dice at 17th level.</p>\n<h2>Relentless Rage</h2>\n<p>Starting at 11th level, your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points while you're raging and don't die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead.</p>\n<p>Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10.</p>\n<h2>Persistent Rage</h2>\n<p>Beginning at 15th level, your rage is so fierce that it ends early only if you fall unconscious or if you choose to end it.</p>\n<h2>Indomitable Might</h2>\n<p>Beginning at 18th level, if your total for a Strength check is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total.</p>\n<h2>Primal Champion</h2>\n<p>At 20th level, you embody the power of the wilds. Your Strength or Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Consitution score increases by 2. Your maximum for those scores increases by 2.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you can enter rage an unlimited number of times, and entering rage no longer requires your bonus action.</p>\n<h2>Berserker Instincts</h2>\n<p>The instincts are presented in alphabetical order. If an instinct has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn it. You can learn an instinct at the same time you meet its prerequisites.</p>\n<h3>Acklay&rsquo;s Instinct</h3>\n<p>While raging, you have advantage on Constitution saving throws.</p>\n<h3>Bantha&rsquo;s Instinct</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 7th level</em><br />Your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift doubles. If it would already double, it instead triples. Additionally, you have advantage on Strength checks made to push, pull, lift, or break objects.</p>\n<h3>Blurrg&rsquo;s Instinct</h3>\n<p>Whether mounted or on foot, your travel pace is doubled, as is the travel pace of up to ten companions while they&rsquo;re within 60 feet of you and you&rsquo;re not incapacitated.</p>\n<h3>Boggdo&rsquo;s Instinct</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 13th level</em><br />While raging you have a flying speed equal to your current walking speed, though you fall if you end your turn in the air and nothing else is holding you aloft.</p>\n<h3>Chirodactyl&rsquo;s Instinct</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 7th level</em><br />While raging, you have blindsight to a range of 30 feet, and you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sound, as long as you aren&rsquo;t deafened.</p>\n<h3>Dewback&rsquo;s Instinct</h3>\n<p>Choose three damage types. While raging, you have resistance to the chosen damage types.</p>\n<h3>Fighter&rsquo;s Instinct</h3>\n<p>You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the Fighting Style options, detailed in Chapter 6. You can&rsquo;t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p>\n<h3>Fyrnock&rsquo;s Instinct</h3>\n<p>While raging, you can use your bonus action to leap up to 30 feet to an empty space you can see. When you land you deal kinetic damage equal to your Strength modifier to each creature within 5 feet of where you land. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.</p>\n<h3>Hawk&rsquo;s Instinct</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 7th level</em><br />You can see up to 1 mile away with no difficulty. You are able to discern even fine details as though looking at something no more than 100 feet away from you. Additionally, dim light doesn&rsquo;t impose disadvantage on your Wisdom (Perception) checks.</p>\n<h3>Katarn&rsquo;s Instinct</h3>\n<p>You gain a climbing speed equal to your movement speed.</p>\n<h3>Llothcat&rsquo;s Instinct</h3>\n<p>While you&rsquo;re raging, other creatures have disadvantage on opportunity attack rolls against you, you can also use the Dash action as a bonus action on your turn.</p>\n<h3>Predator&rsquo;s Instinct</h3>\n<p>Your speed increases by 10 feet.</p>\n<h3>Rancor&rsquo;s Instinct</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 13th level</em><br />While you&rsquo;re raging any creature within 5 feet of you that&rsquo;s hostile to you has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you or another character with this feature. An enemy is immune to this effect if it can&rsquo;t see or hear you or if it can&rsquo;t be frightened.</p>\n<h3>Tactician&rsquo;s Instinct</h3>\n<p>When you use your Reckless Attack feature, you can choose to not have advantage on your attack rolls this turn.

He rounds the corner into the prison while the lights and power are still out, urging the weakened prisoners to escape. Just then a handful of slavers arrive and ready their blasters. The man draws and ignites a white-bladed lightsaber, ready to die for the strangers behind him.</p>\n<p>A sith pureblood, clad head to toe in black and red armor, charges towards a line of soldiers.

At the arrival of this powerful Jedi, the attackers fall back.</p>\n<p>Guardians are the master of the art of lightsaber combat. They focus on utilizing the everpresent power of the Force to enable devastating attacks, often single-handedly turning the tide of battle.</p>\n<h2>Protector or Destroyer</h2>\n<p>An unstoppable agent of the Force, the guardian channels the power flowing through him into his weapons. Their skills with a lightsaber are unrivalled. Subduing their enemies and bolstering their allies, the guardian uses the Force to control what happens around them.</p>\n<h2>Natural Leaders</h2>\n<p>The guardian&rsquo;s command of the Force lends them a powerful presence. Whether through fear and intimidation or respect and admiration, the guardian is one of the greatest generals on the battlefield. They are a symbol of power to their followers.</p>\n<p>While creating your guardian, consider your attraction to the Force and its most famous practitioners - the Jedi and the Sith. Are you a member of one of the two orders, or do you walk a different path? Are you a soldier tapping into a latent Force-sensitivity? Were you trained in the force from a young age, or did you discover it as an adult? How do you treat those weaker than you? What was your family like? Do you see the Force as light and dark, or an impartial river of gray?</p>\n<h3>Quick Build</h3>\n<p>You can make a guardian quickly by following these suggestions.

Wealth</h3>\n<p>In lieu of the equipment granted by your class and background, you can elect to purchase your starting gear. If you do so, you receive no equipment from your class and background, and instead roll for your starting wealth using the criteria below:</p>\n<table style=\"border: 0px; width: 300px;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 150px;\"><strong>Class</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 150px;\"><strong>Funds</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 150px;\">Guardian</td>\n<td style=\"width: 150px;\">8d4 x 100 cr</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div>\n<h2>Forcecasting</h2>\n<p>Beginning at 1st level, in your meditations on the force, you have learned powers, fragments of knowledge that imbue you with an abiding force ability. See chapter 10 for the general rules of forcecasting and chapter 11 for the force powers list.</p>\n<h3>Force Powers Known</h3>\n<p>You learn 5 force powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Force Powers Known column of the guardian table. You may not learn a force power of a level higher than your Max Power Level, and you may learn a force power at the same time you learn its prerequisite.</p>\n<h3>Force Points</h3>\n<p>You have a number of force points equal to your guardian level x 2, as shown in the Force Points column of the guardian table, + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice). You use these force points to cast force powers. You regain all expended force points when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<h3>Max Power Level</h3>\n<p>Many force powers can be overpowered, consuming more force points to create a greater effect. You can overpower these abilities to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the guardian table.</p>\n<p>You may only cast force powers at 5th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.</p>\n<h3>Forcecasting Ability</h3>\n<p>Your forcecasting ability varies based on the alignment of the powers you cast. You use your Wisdom for light side powers, Charisma for dark side powers, and Wisdom or Charisma for universal powers (your choice). You use this ability score modifier whenever a power refers to your forcecasting ability. In addition, you use this ability score modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a force power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p><strong>Force save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your forcecasting ability modifier</p>\n<p><strong>Force attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your forcecasting ability modifier</p>\n<h2>Channel the Force</h2>\n<p>You know how to channel the Force to create a unique effect. You start with your choice from two such effects: Cause Harm and Lend Aid. At 3rd level, your Guardian Focus grants you an additional effect. When you use your Channel the Force, you choose which effect to create.</p>\n<p>Some Channel the Force effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your universal force save DC.</p>\n<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<h3>Cause Harm</h3>\n<p>As an action, you can expend a use of your Channel the Force to sap the life from a hostile creature you can see within 60 feet. That creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes necrotic damage equal to your guardian level + your Charisma modifier (minimum of one), or half as much on a successful one.</p>\n<h3>Lend Aid</h3>\n<p>As a bonus action, you can expend a use of your Channel the Force and touch a beast or humanoid within 5 feet of you. That creature regains hit points equal to your guardian level + your Wisdom modifier (minimum of one). Alternatively, if the beast or humanoid is poisoned or diseased, you neutralize the poison or disease. If more than one poison or disease afflicts the target, you neutralize one poison or disease that you know is present, or you neutralize one at random.</p>\n<h2>Force-Empowered Strikes</h2>\n<p>Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend force points to deal additional damage to the target, which is the same type as the weapon&rsquo;s damage. The additional damage is 1d8 for each point spent in this way. You can&rsquo;t deal more additional damage than the amount shown in the Focused Strikes column of the guardian table.</p>\n<h2>Fighting Style</h2>\n<p>Also at 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the fighting style options, detailed in Chapter 6. You can&rsquo;t take a fighting style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p>\n<h2>Guardian Aura</h2>\n<p>When you reach 3rd level, you gain an aura of your choice, as detailed at the end of the class description. You gain an additional aura at 10th and 18th level.</p>\n<h2>Guardian Focus</h2>\n<p>Also at 3rd level, you begin to focus your studies on a specific lightsaber form, which is detailed at the end of the class description. Your focus grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level.</p>\n<h2>Ability Score Improvement</h2>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Alternatively, you can choose a feat (see Chapter 6 for a list of feats).</p>\n<h2>Extra Attack</h2>\n<p>Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>\n<h2>Force Purity</h2>\n<p>By 6th level, the Force flowing through you makes you immune to poison and disease.</p>\n<h2>Improved Force-Empowered Strikes</h2>\n<p>By 11th level, you are so in tune with the Force that all your melee weapon strikes carry the power of the Force with them. Whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon, the creature takes an extra 1d8 damage. If you also use your Force-Empowered Strikes with an attack, you add this damage to the extra damage of your Force-Empowered Strikes. The damage is the same type as the weapon's damage.</p>\n<h2>Cleansing Touch</h2>\n<p>Beginning at 14th level, you can use your action and expend a use of your Channel the Force ability to end one force power on yourself or on one willing creature that you touch.</p>\n<h2>Guardian Auras</h2>\n<p>The auras are presented in alphabetical order. If multiple guardians grant the same aura, affected creatures can only benefit from it once. You must be conscious to grant the benefits of your auras.</p>\n<p>At 9th level, the range of these auras increases to 15 feet, and at 17th level, the range of these auras increases to 30 feet.</p>\n<h3>Aura of Conquest</h3>\n<p>Whenever a creature who is frightened of you starts its turn within 5 feet of you, its speed is reduced to 0 and that creature takes psychic damage equal to half your guardian level.</p>\n<h3>Aura of Conviction</h3>\n<p>You and friendly creatures within 5 feet of you have advantage on saving throws against effects that would cause you to be charmed or frightened.</p>\n<h3>Aura of Hatred</h3>\n<p>You and friendly creatures within 5 feet of you gain a bonus to the first melee weapon damage rolls you make each round equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of +1).</p>\n<h3>Aura of Presence</h3>\n<p>Whenever you or a friendly creature within 5 feet of you must make a saving throw, the creature gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of +1).</p>\n<h3>Aura of Protection</h3>\n<p>Whenever a creature within 5 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to take that damage instead of that creature taking it. This feature doesn&rsquo;t transfer any other effects that might accompany the damage, and this damage can&rsquo;t be reduced in any way.</p>\n<h3>Aura of Vigor</h3>\n<p>Whenever a friendly creature starts its turn within 5 feet of you, that creature gains temporary hit points equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one).</p>\n<h3>Aura of Warding</h3>\n<p>You and friendly creatures within 5 feet of you have resistance to damage from force powers.</p>\n</div>"},"className":{"value":"Guardian"},"atFlavorText":{"value":"<h1>Guardian Foci</h1>\n<p>Different guardians focus on different lightsaber styles, called Forms, as they hone their powers.

He peers through his tinted goggles, ignoring the shouts of his ship captain as the enemy descends on the hanger. Finally he shouts with pride as the repaired coupling powers up, causing the frigate to hum with energy. He gathers his tools and runs into the ship moments before it finally takes off.</p>\n<p>Inside, the human captain jumps into the cockpit. She nods to her droid co-pilot, who quickly begins charting a course home. Before the calculations can be completed, enemy Starfighters scream in from the clouds. The pilot rolls the ship, nimbly evading incoming fire. She reroutes the power to shields, leaving just enough for astronavigation. Just as the energy reserves near depletion, the exosphere and stars beyond blur into streaks of light. In a flash, they warp to safety.</p>\n<p>A Cerean officer surveys the battlefield, looking for weaknesses. When he identifies a potential problem, he keys in a quick combination in his wristpad. In a blink, a custom suit of armor assembles itself around him. As the helmet locks into place, the officer leaps into the air, flying overhead and raining destruction on the opposition.</p>\n<p>Every machine needs an engineer to run it, and a living crew is no different. Engineers are the experts and professionals who rely on skill, bravery, and their tools to survive and keep others alive. While they do not claim to be fighters, their mere presence can turn the tide of battle or simply keep operations running.</p>\n<h2>Behind the Curtain</h2>\n<p>While perhaps not as intimidating as a heavily-armored trooper, or as exotic as a lighsaber-wielding guardian, engineers are no less vital to group dynamic. They are armorers and gunsmiths, electricians and welders, or any other facet to be found in facilities across the galaxy. Their work, often unsung, is what keeps starships (and their crew) intact.</p>\n<h2>Unflappable</h2>\n<p>It takes bravery for a soldier to enter a battlefield. It perhaps takes more for someone who is unarmed, and untrained in combat, to do the same. Engineers put their lives on the line for a living, whether by choice or acknowledging their plights as an occupational hazard. Whether they come from an elite training academy or learned their talents surviving in the slums, they are no strangers to danger and conflict.</p>\n<p>While creating your engineer character, consider what your primary skill set is and how you use it. You could be a street-smart mechanic who taught yourself how to fix swoop bikes as a teenager. Perhaps you are the recent graduate of an esteemed medical college, or a rookie pilot in the fledgling Rebel Alliance. What is the number one skill you are known for? Why are you willing to enter battles when you have no combat training? How do you view the more adventurous members of your group, and how do they see you and your role?</p>\n<h3>Quick Build</h3>\n<p>You can make an engineer quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Intelligence your highest ability score. Your next-highest score should be Constitution.

8 + your Constitution modifier</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong> 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per engineer level after 1st</p>\n<h3>Proficiencies</h3>\n<div><strong>Armor:</strong> Light armor\n<p><strong>Weapons:</strong> Simple blasters, simple vibroweapons</p>\n<p><strong>Tools:</strong> Tinker's tools, and one of your choice</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throws:</strong> Constitution, Intelligence</p>\n<p><strong>Skills:</strong> Choose three from Investigation, Lore, Medicine, Nature, Piloting, and Technology</p>\n<h3>Equipment</h3>\n<p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>(a)</em> a simple vibroweapon or <em>(b)</em> a simple blaster and two power cells</li>\n<li><em>(a)</em> a dungeoneer&rsquo;s pack or <em>(b)</em> an explorer&rsquo;s pack</li>\n<li>Combat suit, a set of tinker&rsquo;s implements, a vibrodagger, and a wristpad</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"mt-2\">Variant: Starting Wealth</h3>\n<p>In lieu of the equipment granted by your class and background, you can elect to purchase your starting gear. If you do so, you receive no equipment from your class and background, and instead roll for your starting wealth using the criteria below:</p>\n<table style=\"border: 0px; width: 300px;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 150px;\"><strong>Class</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 150px;\"><strong>Funds</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 150px;\">Engineer</td>\n<td style=\"width: 150px;\">6d4 x 100 cr</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<br />\n<h2>Techcasting</h2>\n<p>Beginning at 1st level, during your training you have derived powers from schematics with the aid of your wristpad. See chapter 10 for the general rules of techcasting and chapter 12 for the tech powers list.</p>\n<h3>Tech Powers Known</h3>\n<p>You learn 6 tech powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Tech Powers Known column of the engineer table. You may not learn a tech power of a level higher than your Max Power Level.</p>\n<h3>Tech Points</h3>\n<p>You have a number of tech points equal to your engineer level x 2, as shown in the Tech Points column of the engineer table, + your Intelligence modifier. You use these tech points to cast tech powers. You regain all expended tech points when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<h3>Max Power Level</h3>\n<p>Many tech powers can be overcharged, consuming more tech points to create a greater effect. You can overcharge these powers to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the engineer class table.</p>\n<p>You may only cast tech powers at 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.</p>\n<h3>Techcasting Ability</h3>\n<p>Intelligence is your techcasting ability for your tech powers. You use your Intelligence whenever a power refers to your techcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a tech power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p><strong>Tech save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\n<p><strong>Tech attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\n<h3>Techcasting Focus</h3>\n<p>You use a wristpad (found in chapter 5) or your tool proficiencies granted by this class as a techcasting focus for your tech powers.</p>\n<h2>Potent Aptitude</h2>\n<p>Also at 1st level, your technological experience lends you an uncommon insight that you can use to bolster your allies. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Potent Aptitude die, a d4. This die changes as you gain engineer levels, as shown in the Potent Aptitude column of the engineer table.</p>\n<p>Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Potent Aptitude die, but must decide before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Potent Aptitude die is rolled, it is lost.</p>\n<p>A creature can have only one Potent Aptitude die at a time.</p>\n<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p>Your Potent Aptitude die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level.</p>\n<h2>Infuse Item</h2>\n<p>At 2nd level, you gain the ability to temporarily enhance a weapon or armor. At the end of a long rest, you can touch one unenhanced object that is a suit of armor, a shield, or a simple or martial weapon. Until the end of your next long rest or until you die, the object becomes an enhanced item, granting a +1 bonus to AC if it's armor or a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls if it's a weapon.</p>\n<p>Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p>This bonus increases to +2 at 10th level and +3 at 15th level.</p>\n<h2>Tool Expertise</h2>\n<p>Also at 2nd level, you gain expertise in any tool proficiencies you gain from this class.</p>\n<h2>Engineering Discipline</h2>\n<p>Starting at 3rd level, you begin to focus on a specific engineering discipline, which is detailed at the end of the class description. Your discipline grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 14th, and 18th level.</p>\n<h2>Ability Score Improvement</h2>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can&rsquo;t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Alternatively, you can choose a feat (see Chapter 6 for a list of feats).</p>\n<h2>Quick Thinking</h2>\n<p>Beginning when you reach 5th level, you regain all of your expended uses of Potent Aptitude when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<h2>Tech Mastery</h2>\n<p>At 20th level, your mastery of technology is unrivaled. Your Constitution and Intelligence scores increase by 2. Your maximum for those scores increases by 2.</p>\n<p>Additionally, when you roll initiative and have no uses of Potent Aptitude left, you regain one use.</p>\n</div>"},"className":{"value":"Engineer"},"atFlavorText":{"value":"<h1>Engineering Disciplines</h1>\n<p>The wide range of tool applications gives birth to well defined distinctions between different engineering disciplines.

She gives the order and her allies unleash a single coordinated attack cutting deep into their lines. Under her command the enemy is quickly routed against all odds, all according to plan.</p>\n<p>Deep within the once thought abandoned ruins, a nautolan tends to his companions wounds as they rest. Countless long nights of study and training have conditioned him to keep going even when all others have exhausted themselves. He will see them through this.</p>\n<p>A twi&rsquo;lek in fine vestments addresses a gathering crowd. What was the making of an angry mob begins to disperse, his mere presence putting them at ease, giving his companions time to make their escape.</p>\n<p>Scholars are master of the mundane arts, using methodical practices to turn the tables to their advantage. From years of study and testing, scholars take in the situation around them and quickly formulate the means to achieve whatever they have minds set to. Whatever pursuit they follow, a scholar will have a plan for anything that comes their way.</p>\n<h2>The Pursuit of Knowledge</h2>\n<p>A true scholar is never satisfied. They are always seeking out a new answer to a new question. This often goes hand-in-hand with seeking a life of adventure, to explore new, hidden areas, or accompany those that do. The life of a scholar often times begins in the mundane, as a teacher or sage. Sometimes they serve as doctors, diplomats, or as officers in the military.</p>\n<h2>To Learn, To Know</h2>\n<p>For scholars, mundane life is often too slow. When life becomes stagnant or when an answer cannot be found, the call to adventure rings louder. Scholars will often go to ancient, forgotten, and often dangerous places to find something to quench their thirst for knowledge.</p>\n<p>As you create a scholar, it's important to think of where you gained your knowledge. Did you serve as an apprentice under a master? Did you attend college or other formal education? Perhaps you gained it on your own, searching out and pouring over dusty tomes found in forgotten places. Where did your thirst for knowledge come from? Insatiable curiosity? Always wanting to know the right answer? Or do you have something to prove? Think about what field you wish to pursue and think of what is driving you in that direction.</p>\n<h3>Quick Build</h3>\n<p>You can make a scholar quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Intelligence your highest ability score. Your next-highest score should be Dexterity. Second, choose the @Compendium[sw5e.backgrounds.aiBPuaLODR08hveu]{Noble}

techblades</p>\n<p><strong>Tools:</strong> Any one</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throws:</strong> Wisdom, Intelligence</p>\n<p><strong>Skills:</strong> Choose three from Deception, Insight, Intimidation, Investigation, Lore, Medicine, Nature, Persuasion, and Survival</p>\n<h3>Equipment</h3>\n<p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>(a)</em> a simple vibroweapon or <em>(b)</em> a simple blaster and two power cells</li>\n<li><em>(a)</em> scholar&rsquo;s pack or <em>(b)</em> explorer&rsquo;s pack</li>\n<li>a combat suit</li>\n<li>any tool of your choice</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"mt-2\">Variant: Starting Wealth</h3>\n<p>In lieu of the equipment granted by your class and background, you can elect to purchase your starting gear. If you do so, you receive no equipment from your class and background, and instead roll for your starting wealth using the criteria below:</p>\n<table style=\"border: 0px; width: 300px;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 150px;\"><strong>Class</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 150px;\"><strong>Funds</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 150px;\">Scholar</td>\n<td style=\"width: 150px;\">6d4 x 100 cr</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Academic Superiority</h2>\n<p>Beginning at 1st level, you learn maneuvers that are fueled by special dice called superiority dice.</p>\n<h3>Maneuvers</h3>\n<p>You know two maneuvers of your choice, which are detailed under &ldquo;Maneuvers&rdquo; below, and you earn more at higher levels, as shown in the Maneuvers Known column of the scholar class table. Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one maneuver per attack, and you may only use each maneuver once per turn.</p>\n<p>Each time you learn new maneuvers, you can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one.</p>\n<h3>Superiority Dice</h3>\n<p>You have two superiority dice, which are d4s, and you earn more at higher levels, as shown in the Superiority Dice column of the scholar class table. This die changes as you gain scholar levels, as shown in the Academic Superiority column of the scholar class table. A superiority die is expended when you use it.</p>\n<p>You regain all of your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<h3>Saving Throws</h3>\n<p>Some of your maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver&rsquo;s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>\n<p><strong>Maneuver save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\n<h2>Maneuvers</h2>\n<p>The maneuvers are presented in alphabetical order.</p>\n<h3>Administer Aid</h3>\n<p>As an action, you can expend a superiority die to tend to a creature you can touch. The creature regains a number of hit points equal to the number rolled + your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<h3>Assess the Situation</h3>\n<p>You can expend one superiority die to make a Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation) check as a bonus action, adding the superiority die to the check.</p>\n<h3>Crippling Strike</h3>\n<p>When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to cripple the creature. You add the superiority die to the attack&rsquo;s damage roll and the creature&rsquo;s speed is reduced by 10 feet until the end of their next turn.</p>\n<h3>Deliberate Movement</h3>\n<p>You can expend one superiority die to take the Disengage action as a bonus action and ignore the effects of standard difficult terrain until the end of your turn.</p>\n<h3>Exploit Weakness</h3>\n<p>When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend a superiority die and deal additional damage equal to the number rolled. This damage cannot be reduced in any way.</p>\n<h3>Goading Attack</h3>\n<p>When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to goad the target into attacking you. You add the superiority die to the attack&rsquo;s damage roll, and the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on all attack rolls against targets other than you until the end of your next turn.</p>\n<h3>Heads Up</h3>\n<p>When a friendly creature who can see or hear you makes a saving throw, you can use your reaction and expend a superiority die, adding the number rolled to the result of the saving throw. You can use this maneuver before or after making the saving throw, but before any effects of the saving throw are determined.</p>\n<h3>Measured Action</h3>\n<p>As a reaction when you make a roll for a contested skill check, you can expend a superiority die to add to the roll. You can use this maneuver before or after making the contested skill check roll, but before any effects of the contested skill check are determined.</p>\n<h3>One Step Ahead</h3>\n<p>When you roll initiative and you are not surprised, you can expend a superiority die and add the number rolled to your initiative.</p>\n<h3>Targeted Strike</h3>\n<p>When an ally makes an attack against a creature, you can use your reaction to expend a superiority die. You add the superiority die to the attack roll, and the damage roll if it hits. You can use this maneuver before or after the attack roll, but before the GM determines whether or not the attack hits.</p>\n<h2>Critical Analysis</h2>\n<p>At 1st level, you are able to analyze a target, develop a plan on how to best overcome any potential obstacle, and execute that plan with ruthless efficiency. As a bonus action on your turn, you can analyze a target you can see within 60 feet of you. For the next minute, or until you analyze another target, you gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When you analyze a hostile creature, your attack and damage rolls made with weapons with the finesse property or blaster weapons against that target may use your Intelligence modifier instead of Strength or Dexterity.</li>\n<li>When you analyze a friendly creature, the target can end your Critical Analysis on them (no action required) to add your Intelligence modifier to one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw. Once a friendly creature has benefited from this ability, they can not do so again until they complete a short or long rest.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Discovery</h2>\n<p>As you adventure, your studies have helped you discover new practices you can apply to your skills.</p>\n<p>At 2nd level, you master two discoveries of your choice. Your discovery options are detailed at the end of the class description. When you gain certain scholar levels, you gain additional discoveries of your choice, as shown in the Discoveries column of the scholar class table.</p>\n<p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the discoveries you know and replace it with another discovery that you could learn at that level.</p>\n<h2>Sage Advice</h2>\n<p>When you reach 2nd level, you can spend 1 minute spreading your knowledge and experience, advising those around you. When you do so, choose a skill or tool you are proficient with and a number of friendly creatures up to your Intelligence modifier within 30 feet of you who can hear you and who can understand you. Once within the next hour, the next time each creature would make an ability check with the chosen skill or tool, they may add their proficiency bonus to the roll if they are not already proficient. A creature may only benefit from this feature once. If a creature is targeted by this feature again before using it, they can choose to retain the first benefit or replace it with the new skill or tool instead.</p>\n<p>Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest. Starting at 13th level, you regain the ability to use it after you complete a short or long rest.</p>\n<h2>Expertise</h2>\n<p>At 3rd level, choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of skill proficiencies and one of your tool proficiencies, or two of your tool proficiencies. You gain expertise in those skills or tools.</p>\n<p>At 10th level, you can choose another two proficiencies (in skills or tools) to gain this benefit.</p>\n<h2>Academic Pursuit</h2>\n<p>At 3rd level, you dedicate your studies towards a pursuit, which is detailed at the end of the class description. The pursuit you choose grants you features at 3rd level, and again at 6th, 9th, and 17th level.</p>\n<h2>Ability Score Improvement</h2>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two Ability Scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can&rsquo;t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Alternatively, you can choose a feat (see Chapter 6 for a list of feats).</p>\n<h2>Multitasker</h2>\n<p>Starting at 5th level, you can take a second reaction each round. You can only take one reaction per turn.</p>\n<p>Additionally, when a friendly creature you can see that can hear you is forced to make a saving throw, you can use your reaction to target them with your Critical Analysis feature.</p>\n<h2>Calm and Collected</h2>\n<p>Beginning at 14th level, when you make a saving throw from an effect you can see, you may gain a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<p>Once you have used this feature, you must wait until a short or long rest before using it again.</p>\n<h2>Adaptable Intellectual</h2>\n<p>At 18th level, you are able to effectively prepare for any mission on hand. At the end of a long rest, you may choose one of the discoveries you know and replace it with another discover that you could learn at that level.</p>\n<h2>Knowledge Unbound</h2>\n<p>When you reach 20th level, you are the pinnacle of your pursuit. Your Intelligence score increases by 4. Your maximum for that score increases by 4. Additionally, you can use any maneuver you know without expending a superiority die, rolling a d4 instead.</p>\n<h2>Academic Pursuits</h2>\n<p>Your pursuit is a representation of which fields you have studied or how you practically apply your knowledge.</p>\n<h2>Discoveries</h2>\n<p>The discoveries are presented in alphabetical order. If a discovery has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn it. If a discovery requires a level, you must be that level in this class to learn the discovery. You can learn the discovery at the same time you meet its prerequisites.</p>\n<h3>Academic Memory</h3>\n<p>You can recall anything you have read in the past month that you understand. This includes but is not limited to books, maps, signs, and lists.</p>\n<h3>Adaptive</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 15th level</em><br />When the target of your Critical Analysis feature is reduced to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to change the target of your analysis to another creature within range.</p>\n<h3>Ambassador</h3>\n<p>You learn three additional languages of your choice.</p>\n<p>You my choose this discovery multiple times.</p>\n<h3>Clever Applications</h3>\n<p>You gain proficiency with improvised weapons, and they gain the finesse property for you. Additionally, when you make an attack with an improvised weapon, it deals 1d6 damage.</p>\n<p>You can use your Sage Advice feature to give friendly creatures improvised weapon proficiency if they don&rsquo;t already have it, following the same rules of that feature as if it were a skill or tool. The friendly creatures retain this proficiency for the entire duration instead.</p>\n<h3>Mental Prowess</h3>\n<p>When you make a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to grapple a creature or break out of a grapple, net, and other restraining equipment, you can use your Intelligence modifier instead of Strength or Dexterity.</p>\n<h3>Hardened Mind</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 9th level</em><br />You have advantage on saving throws against illusions and on Intelligence checks to discern them from reality.</p>\n<p>You also gain resistance to psychic damage.</p>\n<h3>Lifelong Learning</h3>\n<p>You gain proficiency in a skill and a tool, or two tools.</p>\n<p>You can select this discovery multiple times, each time choosing a new skill and a tool, or two new tools.</p>\n<h3>Lingering Advice</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 5th level</em><br />When you use your Sage Advice feature, the targeted creatures retain the benefit from your instruction for the full duration.</p>\n<h3>Master&rsquo;s Advice</h3>\n<p>When you use your Sage Advice feature, the first time each targeted creature makes the chosen skill check, they gain an additional bonus to the roll equal to your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<h3>Perfect Maneuver</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 15th level</em><br />When you roll a 1 on a superiority die, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll.</p>\n<h3>Quick Analysis</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 9th level</em><br />When you roll initiative and aren&rsquo;t surprised, you can use your reaction to use your Critical Analysis feature.</p>\n<h3>Reliable Sources</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 9th level</em><br />When you make an Intelligence (Lore) or Intelligence (Nature) skill check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.</p>\n<h3>Resolute</h3>\n<p>When you make a saving throw to resist charm and fear effects, you may add your Intelligence modifier to the roll.</p>\n<h3>Running on Fumes</h3>\n<p>You only need 4 hours of sleep to gain the benefit of a long rest.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you have advantage on saving throws against exhaustion.</p>\n<h3>Survival Expert</h3>\n<p>When you make a Survival skill check, you may use your Intelligence modifier instead of your Wisdom modifier.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you have advantage on saving throws against poison.</p>\n<h3>Targeted Analysis</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 5th level</em><br />Your attack rolls against the target of your critical analysis feature cannot suffer from disadvantage.</p>\n<h3>Tech Amateur</h3>\n<p>Choose one 1st-level tech power. You learn that power and can cast it at its lowest level without expending tech points. Once you cast it in this way, you must finish a long rest before you can cast it again. Your techcasting ability for this power is Intelligence.</p>\n<p>You can select this discovery multiple times. Each time you do so, you must choose a different power.</p>\n<h3>Universal Language</h3>\n<p>You can communicate simple ideas with any creature with an Intelligence score of 6 or higher through basic expressions and gestures.</p>"},"className":{"value":"Scholar"},"atFlavorText":{"value":"<h1>Academic Pursuits</h1>\n<p>Your pursuit is a representation of which fields you have studied or how you practically apply your knowledge.

As he prepares to leap a gap, a blaster bolt hits him in the back and renders him unconscious. His blurry vision barely makes out the figure of a masked woman who casually approaches, ready to collect her bounty.</p>\n<p>With his muscular arms held wide, a grizzled-looking Wookiee grins to his bloodthirsty crowd. He turns back to his arena opponent just in time to see the Besalisk take a swing. He ducks, punching the four-armed fighter in the gut. Two wild haymakers later, and he stands alone as the gladiatorial champion.</p>\n<p>Taking a deep breath, a Republic soldier looks out onto the war zone waging across the frozen surface of Ilum. He grips his blaster rifle tightly then, with a nod to the dozen squad-mates beside him, he charges onto the battlefield.</p>\n<p>Fighters combine discipline with martial skills to become the best pure warriors in the galaxy. Fighters can be stalwart defenders of those in need, cruel marauders, or brave advent-urers. They fight for glory, honor, to right wrongs, to gain power, to acquire wealth, or simple for the thrill of battle.</p>\n<h2>All in a Day&rsquo;s Work</h2>\n<p>Many fighters see adventures, raids on enemy strongholds, and dangerous missions as their jobs. Some want to defend those who can&rsquo;t defend themselves while others seek to use their muscle to carve their own place of importance in the galaxy. Fighters can take the form of guards, champions, bounty hunters, enforcers, mercenaries, freedom fighters, or simply armed explorers.</p>\n<h2>Code Red</h2>\n<p>Most fighters come to the profession after receiving at least some amount of formal training from a military organization. Some attend formal academies; others are self-taught and well tested. A fighter may have taken up his weapon to escape a mundane life while another may be following a proud family tradition. Whatever their origins, most fighters share an unshakeable loyalty. Fighters follow orders with little hesitation, as failure can often mean death.</p>\n<p>While creating your fighter character, consider where your loyalties lie. You could be part of a formal military, one of countless troopers fighting for your enterprise. Perhaps you are a gun-for-hire, traveling the galaxy in search of your next gig. What weapons do you prefer and specialize in? Who or what do you fight for? Do you have aspirations of a life beyond the battlefield, or have you been at war so long you know of nothing else?</p>\n<h3>Quick Build</h3>\n<p>You can make a fighter quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Strength or Dexterity your highest ability modifier, depending on whether you want to focus on melee combat or on ranged weapons (or finesse weapons). Your next-highest score should be Constitution. Second, choose the @Compendium[sw5e.backgrounds.6jOIxwB8TYnShEJJ]{Soldier}

Choose one of the Fighting Style options, detailed in Chapter 6. You can&rsquo;t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p>\n<h2>Second Wind</h2>\n<p>You have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to protect yourself from harm. On your turn, you can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your fighter level.</p>\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve used this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p>\n<h2>Action Surge</h2>\n<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action on top of your regular action and a possible bonus action.</p>\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve used this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. Starting at 17th level, you can use it twice before a rest, but only once on the same turn.</p>\n<h2>Combat Superiority</h2>\n<p>Also at 2nd level, you learn maneuvers that are fueled by special dice called superiority dice.</p>\n<h3>Maneuvers</h3>\n<p>You learn two maneuvers of your choice, which are detailed under &ldquo;Maneuvers&rdquo; below, and you earn more at higher levels, as shown in the Maneuvers Known column of the fighter class table. Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one maneuver per attack, and you may only use each maneuver once per turn.</p>\n<p>Each time you learn new maneuvers, you can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one.</p>\n<h3>Superiority Dice</h3>\n<p>You have two superiority dice, which are d4s, and you earn more at higher levels, as shown in the Superiority Dice column of the fighter class table. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<h3>Saving Throws</h3>\n<p>Some of your maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver&rsquo;s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>\n<p><strong>Maneuver save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice)</p>\n<h2>Maneuvers</h2>\n<p>The maneuvers are presented in alphabetical order.</p>\n<h3>Commander&rsquo;s Strike</h3>\n<p>When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can forgo one of your attacks and use a bonus action to direct one of your companions to strike. When you do so, choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you and expend one superiority die. That creature can immediately use its reaction to make one weapon attack, adding the superiority die to the attack&rsquo;s damage roll.</p>\n<h3>Disarming Attack</h3>\n<p>When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to disarm the target, forcing it to drop one item of your choice that it&rsquo;s holding. You add the superiority die to the attack&rsquo;s damage roll, and the target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it drops the object you choose. The object lands at its feet.</p>\n<h3>Distracting Strike</h3>\n<p>When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to distract the creature, giving your allies an opening. You add the superiority die to the attack&rsquo;s damage roll. The next attack roll against the target by an attacker other than you has advantage if the attack is made before the start of your next turn.</p>\n<h3>Evasive Footwork</h3>\n<p>When you move, you can expend one superiority die, rolling the die and adding the number rolled to your AC until you stop moving.</p>\n<h3>Feinting Attack</h3>\n<p>You can expend one superiority die and use a bonus action on your turn to feint, choosing one creature within 5 feet of you as your target. You have advantage on your next attack roll against that creature. If that attack hits, add the superiority die to the attack&rsquo;s damage roll.</p>\n<h3>Goading Attack</h3>\n<p>When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to goad the target into attacking you. You add the superiority die to the attack&rsquo;s damage roll, and the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on all attack rolls against targets other than you until the end of your next turn.</p>\n<h3>Lunging Attack</h3>\n<p>When you make a melee weapon attack on your turn, you can expend one superiority die to increase your reach for that attack by 5 feet. If you hit, you add the superiority die to the attack&rsquo;s damage roll.</p>\n<h3>Maneuvering Attack</h3>\n<p>When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to maneuver one of your comrades into a more advantageous position. You add the superiority die to the attack&rsquo;s damage roll, and you choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you.</p>\n<p>That creature can use its reaction to move up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks from the target of your attack.</p>\n<h3>Menacing Attack</h3>\n<p>When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to frighten the target. You add the superiority die to the attack&rsquo;s damage roll, and the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it is frightened of you until the end of your next turn.</p>\n<h3>Parry</h3>\n<p>When another creature damages you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction and expend one superiority die to reduce the damage by the number you roll on your superiority die + your Dexterity modifier.</p>\n<h3>Precision Attack</h3>\n<p>When you make a weapon attack roll against a creature, you can expend one superiority die to add it to the roll. You can use this maneuver before or after making the attack roll, but before any effects of the attack are applied.</p>\n<h3>Pushing Attack</h3>\n<p>When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to drive the target back. You add the superiority die to the attack&rsquo;s damage roll, and if the target is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you push the target up to 15 feet away from you.</p>\n<h3>Rally</h3>\n<p>On your turn, you can use a bonus action and expend one superiority die to bolster the resolve of one of your companions. When you do so, choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you. That creature gains temporary hit points equal to the superiority die roll + your Charisma modifier.</p>\n<h3>Riposte</h3>\n<p>When a creature misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction and expend one superiority die to make a melee weapon attack against the creature. If you hit, you add the superiority die to the attack&rsquo;s damage roll.</p>\n<h3>Sweeping Attack</h3>\n<p>When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to damage another creature with the same attack. Choose another creature within 5 feet of the original target and within your reach. If the original attack roll would hit the second creature, it takes damage equal to the number you roll on your superiority die. The damage is of the same type dealt by the original attack.</p>\n<h3>Trip Attack</h3>\n<p>When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to knock the target down. You add the superiority die to the attack&rsquo;s damage roll, and if the target is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you knock the target prone.</p>\n<h2>Fighter Specialty</h2>\n<p>At 3rd level, you choose a specialty that you strive to emulate in your combat styles and techniques, which is detailed at the end of the class description. The archetype you choose grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level.</p>\n<h2>Ability Score Improvement</h2>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 6th, 8th, 12th, 14th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can&rsquo;t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Alternatively, you can choose a feat (see Chapter 6 for a list of feats).</p>\n<h2>Extra Attack</h2>\n<p>Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>\n<h2>Indomitable</h2>\n<p>Beginning at 9th level, you can reroll a saving throw that you fail. If you do so, you must use the new roll, and you can&rsquo;t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p>You can use this feature twice between long rests starting at 13th level and three times between long rests starting at 17th level.</p>\n<h2>Greater Extra Attack</h2>\n<p>Beginning at 11th level, you can attack three times, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>\n<p>Additionally, when you use a bonus action to engage in two-weapon fighting, you can make two attacks instead of one.</p>\n<h2>Master of Combat</h2>\n<p>At 20th level, you are the master of combat. Your Strength or Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 2. Your maximum for those scores increases by 2.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you can attack four times, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>"},"className":{"value":"Fighter"},"atFlavorText":{"value":"<h1>Fighter Specialties</h1>\n<p>Different fighters choose different approaches to perfecting their fighting prowess.

She whirls among them, knocking their blows aside and sending them reeling, until at last she stands alone.</p>\n<p>Taking a deep breath, a zabrak covered in tattoos settles into a battle stance. As the first charging mercenaries reach him, he exhales and a blast of negative energy courses from his hands, engulfing his foes.</p>\n<p>Moving with the silence of the night, a black-clad mirialan steps into a shadow beneath an arch and nimbly climbs to the balcony a stone&rsquo;s throw above her. She slides her blade free of its cloth-wrapped scabbard and peers through the open window at the warlord, so vulnerable in the grip of sleep.</p>\n<p>Whatever their discipline, monks are united in their ability to harness the energy that flows in their bodies. Whether channeled as a striking display of combat prowess or a subtler focus of defensive ability and speed, this energy infuses all that a monk does.</p>\n<h2>The Power of Focus</h2>\n<p>Monks make careful study of a mystical energy that most monastic orders call focus. This energy is an element of the power that suffuses the galaxy&mdash;specifically, the element that flows through living bodies. Monks harness this energy within themselves to create powerful effects and exceed their bodies&rsquo; physical capabilities, and some of their special attacks can hinder the flow of focus in their opponents. Using this energy, monks channel uncanny speed and strength into their unarmed strikes. As they gain experience, their martial training and their mastery of focus gives them more power over their bodies and the bodies of their foes.</p>\n<h2>Training and Asceticism</h2>\n<p>Most monks live entirely apart from the surrounding population, secluded from anything that might impede their spiritual progress. Others are sworn to isolation, emerging only to serve as spies or assassins at the command of their leader, a noble patron, or some other power.</p>\n<p>The majority of monks don&rsquo;t shun their neighbors, making frequent visits to nearby towns or villages and exchanging their service for food and other goods. As versatile warriors, monks often end up protecting their neighbors from monsters or brigands.</p>\n<p>For a monk, becoming an adventurer means leaving a structured, communal lifestyle to become a wanderer. This can be a harsh transition, and monks don&rsquo;t undertake it lightly. Those who leave their cloisters take their work seriously, approaching their adventures as personal tests of their physical and spiritual growth.</p>\n<p>As you make your monk character, think about your connection to the monastery where you learned your skills and spent your formative years. Were you an orphan or a child left on the monastery's threshold? Did your parents promise you to the monastery in gratitude for a service performed by the monks? Did you enter this secluded life to hide from a crime you committed? Or did you choose the monastic life for yourself? Consider why you left. Did the head of your monastery choose you for a particularly important mission beyond the cloister? Perhaps you were cast out because of some violation of the community's rules. Did you dread leaving, or were you happy to go? Is there something you hope to accomplish outside the monastery? Are you eager to return to your home? As a result of the structured life of a monastic community and the discipline required to harness focus, monks are typically lawful in alignment.</p>\n<h3>Quick Build</h3>\n<p>You can make a monk quickly by following these suggestions.

class features.</p>\n<h3>Hit Points</h3>\n<p><strong>Hit Dice:</strong> 1d8 per Monk level</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points at 1st Level:</strong> 8 + your Constitution modifier</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong> 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per monk level after 1st</p>\n<h3>Proficiencies</h3>\n<p><strong>Armor:</strong> None</p>\n<p><strong>Weapons:</strong> Simple blasters, simple vibroweapons, chakrams, techblades</p>\n<p><strong>Tools:</strong> None</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throws:</strong> Strength, Dexterity</p>\n<p><strong>Skills:</strong> Choose two from Acrobatics, Athletics, Insight, Lore, Perception, and Stealth</p>\n<h3>Equipment</h3>\n<p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>(a)</em> a chakram, <em>(b)</em> a techblade, <em>(c)</em> a simple vibroweapon, or <em>(d)</em> a simple blaster and a power cell</li>\n<li><em>(a)</em> a dungeoneer&rsquo;s pack or <em>(b)</em> an explorer&rsquo;s pack</li>\n<li>10 vibrodarts</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"mt-2\">Variant: Starting Wealth</h3>\n<p>In lieu of the equipment granted by your class and background, you can elect to purchase your starting gear. If you do so, you receive no equipment from your class and background, and instead roll for your starting wealth using the criteria below:</p>\n<table style=\"border: 0px; width: 300px;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 150px;\"><strong>Class</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 150px;\"><strong>Funds</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 180px;\">Monk</td>\n<td style=\"width: 180px;\">4d4 x 100 cr</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Martial Arts</h2>\n<p>Beginning at 1st level, your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are chakrams, techblades, and any simple vibroweapons that don&rsquo;t have the two-handed property.</p>\n<p>You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons and you aren't wearing armor or wielding a shield:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and monk weapons. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.</li>\n<li>You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or monk weapon. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table.</li>\n<li>You can use Dexterity instead of Strength whenever you would make a Strength (Athletics) check to grapple, shove, or trip a creature.</li>\n<li>When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action.</li>\n<li>You can take the Dash and Disengage actions as a bonus action.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em><strong>Variant: Monks with Lightweapons</strong><br />If monks gain lightweapon proficiency, consider letting them use lightweapons as monk weapons, provided the lightweapon has a vibroweapon analogue. For instance, chakrams count as monk weapons. If a monk gains proficiency in a light ring, they could also use it as a monk weapon.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Unarmored Defense</h2>\n<p>Also at 1st level, while you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice).</p>\n<h2>Focus</h2>\n<p>Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of focus. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of focus points. Your monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Focus Points column of the Monk table.</p>\n<p>You can spend these points to fuel various focus features. You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind. You learn more focus features as you gain levels in this class.</p>\n<p>When you spend a focus point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended focus back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your focus points.</p>\n<p>You use your choice of Wisdom or Charisma for your focus ability. You use the chosen ability modifier whenever a feature refers to your focus ability. Additionally, you use the chosen ability modifier when making an attack with a focus feature or setting the saving throw DC for one.</p>\n<p><strong>Focus save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice)</p>\n<p><strong>Focus attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice)</p>\n<h3>Flurry of Blows</h3>\n<p>When you make your Martial Arts bonus action unarmed strike, you can spend 1 focus point to make an additional unarmed strike (no action required). At 11th level, you can instead spend 2 focus points to make two additional unarmed strikes.</p>\n<h3>Patient Defense</h3>\n<p>When you use your bonus action to Disengage, you can spend 1 focus point to also Dodge (no action required). At 11th level, you can instead spend 2 focus points to Dodge and gain an additional reaction until the start of your next turn. You can only take one reaction per turn.</p>\n<h3>Step of the Wind</h3>\n<p>When you use your bonus action to Dash, you can spend 1 focus point to double your jump distance for the turn. At 11th level, you can instead spend 2 focus points to gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed until the end of your turn, though you fall if you end your speed in the air and nothing else is holding you aloft.</p>\n<h2>Monastic Vows</h2>\n<p>Also at 2nd level, you&rsquo;ve sworn two vows, as detailed at the end of the class description. You swear an additional vow at 7th, 13th, and 17th level.</p>\n<h2>Unarmored Movement</h2>\n<p>Starting at 3rd level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield. This bonus increases when you reach certain monk levels, as shown in the Unarmored Movement column of the monk table.</p>\n<p>At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move.</p>\n<h2>Deflect Missiles</h2>\n<p>Also at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect a projectile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level.</p>\n<p>If you reduce the damage to 0, and the damage is energy or ion, you can redirect it at another target if you have a weapon capable of doing so. You can spend 1 focus point to make a ranged attack as you deflect the projectile, as part of the same reaction. You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and the projectile counts as a monk weapon for the attack.</p>\n<h2>Monastic Order</h2>\n<p>Lastly at 3rd level, you commit yourself to one a monastic order, which is detailed at the end of the class description. Your order grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.</p>\n<h2>Ability Score Improvement</h2>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can&rsquo;t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Alternatively, you can choose a feat (see Chapter 6 for a list of feats).</p>\n<h2>Slow Fall</h2>\n<p>Beginning at 4th level, you can use your reaction when you fall to reduce any falling damage you take by an amount equal to five times your monk level.</p>\n<h2>Extra Attack</h2>\n<p>Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>\n<h2>Stunning Strike</h2>\n<p>Starting at 5th level, you can interfere with an opponent's body. When you hit another creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1 focus point to attempt a stunning strike. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.</p>\n<h2>Enhanced Strikes</h2>\n<p>Starting at 6th level, your unarmed strikes count as enhanced for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to unenhanced attacks and damage.</p>\n<h2>Evasion</h2>\n<p>At 7th level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects. When you are subjected to an effect, such as a consular's <em>force storm</em> or an engineer's <em>explosion</em>, that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on a saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.</p>\n<h2>Stillness of Mind</h2>\n<p>Starting at 7th level, you can use your action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened.</p>\n<h2>Purity of Body</h2>\n<p>Starting at 13th level, your mastery of the focus flowing through you makes you immune to disease and poison and resistant to poison damage.</p>\n<h2>Diamond Soul</h2>\n<p>Beginning at 14th level, your mastery of focus grants you proficiency in all saving throws. Additionally, whenever you make a saving throw and fail, you can spend 1 focus point to reroll it and take the second result.</p>\n<h2>Timeless Vessel</h2>\n<p>At 15th level, your focus sustains you so that you suffer none of the frailty of old age, and you can't be aged abnormally. You can still die of old age, however. Additionally, when you complete a short rest, you can expend a Hit Die to remove 1 level of exhaustion or slowed.</p>\n<h2>Empty Body</h2>\n<p>Beginning at 18th level, you can use your action to spend 4 focus points to become invisible for 1 minute. During that time, you also have resistance to all damage but force damage.</p>\n<h2>Perfect Self</h2>\n<p>At 20th level, you've gained perfect control over your body. Your Dexterity and Wisdom or Charisma scores (your choice) increase by 2. Your maximum for those scores increases by 2. Additionally, when you roll for initiative and have fewer than 6 focus points remaining, you regain up to 6 focus points.</p>\n<h2>Monastic Vows</h2>\n<p>The vows are presented in alphabetical order. If a vow has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn it. You can learn a vow at the same time you meet its prerequisites.</p>\n<h3>Vow of Deflection</h3>\n<p>You can use your reaction to divert a strike when you are dealt damage by a melee weapon attack. When you do so, the damage taken by the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level.</p>\n<h3>Vow of the Devoted</h3>\n<p>You gain a limited ability to manipulate the Force. See chapter 10 for the general rules of forcecasting and chapter 11 for the force powers list.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Force Powers Known.</strong></em> You learn 2 force powers of your choice. You learn an additional power at 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th, 13th, 15th, and 17th level. You may not learn a force power of a level higher than your Max Power Level, and you may learn a force power at the same time you learn its prerequisite. You may only learn universal powers in this way.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Force Points.</strong></em> Rather than force points, powers you learn through this vow are cast using your focus points, at 1 focus point per power level. You may only cast universal powers in this way.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Max Power Level.</strong></em> Many force powers can be overpowered, consuming more focus points to create a greater effect. You can overpower these abilities to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels. Your Max Power Level is 1st. It increases to 2nd at 7th level, 3rd at 13th level, and 4th at 17th level. You may only cast force powers at 4th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Forcecasting Ability.</strong></em> You use your focus ability whenever a power refers to your forcecasting ability. If a power you cast with focus points calls for a saving throw, you use your focus save DC. If a power you cast with focus points calls for an attack roll, you use your focus attack modifier.</p>\n<h3>Vow of Fate</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 7th level</em><br />When you finish a short or long rest, roll a d20 and record the number rolled. Once before your next short or long rest, you can replace any attack roll, saving throw, or ability check made by you or a creature within 5 feet of you with this roll. You must choose to do so before the roll.</p>\n<h3>Vow of the Fighter</h3>\n<p>You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the fighting Style options, detailed in Chapter 6. You can&rsquo;t take a fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p>\n<h3>Vow of Fortitude</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 7th level</em><br />You can use your action or bonus action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be blinded or deafened.</p>\n<h3>Vow of Freedom</h3>\n<p>You ignore unenhanced difficult terrain, and when you would use your action to break free of an effect that is grappling or restraining you, you can instead use your bonus action.</p>\n<h3>Vow of Intuition</h3>\n<p>You can no longer have disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures within 10 feet of you due to not being able to see them.</p>\n<h3>Vow of the Limber</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 7th level</em><br />When you make your first unarmed strike on your turn, you can choose to spend 1 focus point. If you do so, your reach with your unarmed strikes increases by 5 feet until the end of your turn.</p>\n<h3>Vow of Mettle</h3>\n<p>You can use Strength instead of Wisdom or Charisma when determining your Unarmored Defense.</p>\n<h3>Vow of the Mortal</h3>\n<p>You can use Constitution instead of Wisdom or Charisma when determining your Unarmored Defense.</p>\n<h3>Vow of the Nemesis</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 13th level</em><br />As a bonus action, you can choose one creature within 30 feet that you can see. The creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your focus save DC. On a successful save, the creature becomes immune to this feature for 24 hours. On a failed save, for the next minute, the creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures other than you, and it must make an additional Wisdom saving throw each time it attempts to move to a space that is more than 30 feet away from you; if it succeeds on this saving throw, this feature doesn't restrict its movement for that turn.</p>\n<p>This feature ends early if you attack another creature, if you target another hostile creature with a power or class feature, if a friendly creature damages the target, if a friendly creature targets it with a power or class feature, or if you target another creature with this feature.</p>\n<h3>Vow of the Open Mind</h3>\n<p>You gain proficiency in a skill of your choice. Additionally, you can spend 1 focus point and 10 minutes meditating on a skill in which you are proficient. If you do so, when you make an ability check with the chosen skill, you can add your Wisdom or Charisma modifier to the check if it doesn&rsquo;t already include that modifier. You can only have one instance of this feature active at a time.</p>\n<h3>Vow of Precision</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 13th level</em> <br />Your critical hit range with unarmed strikes increases by 1.</p>\n<h3>Vow of Requital</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 13th level</em> <br />When you take the Dodge action and an attack made by a creature within 5 feet of you misses you before the start of your next turn, you can use your reaction to make one melee weapon attack with a monk weapon or unarmed strike against that creature.</p>\n<h3>Vow of Restoration</h3>\n<p>When you would make an unarmed strike, you can spend 1 focus point to instead touch a willing creature within your reach. Roll your Martial Arts die. The target gains hit points equal to the amount rolled + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of +1).</p>\n<h3>Vow of the Sentry</h3>\n<p>You gain proficiency in light and medium armor. Additionally, you can now gain the benefits of your Martial Arts and Unarmored Movement features while wearing light or medium armor as long as you are not wielding a shield.</p>\n<h3>Vow of Serenity</h3>\n<p>Your maximum focus increases by an amount equal to half your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, rounded up, minimum of +1).</p>\n<h3>Vow of the Shrewd</h3>\n<p>You can use Intelligence instead of Wisdom or Charisma when determining your Unarmored Defense.</p>\n<h3>Vow of Spirit</h3>\n<p>You can use your choice of Wisdom or Charisma instead of Strength or Dexterity for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and monk weapons. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.</p>\n<h3>Vow of the Versatile</h3>\n<p>When you would make an unarmed strike as part of your Martial Arts bonus action attack or your Flurry of Blows, you can instead make a melee weapon attack with a monk weapon you are wielding.</p>"},"className":{"value":"Monk"},"atFlavorText":{"value":"<h1>Monastic Orders</h1>\n<p>Orders of monastic pursuit are common in the locales scattered across the galaxy.
