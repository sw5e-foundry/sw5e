      "value": "<p><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Improved Saber Throw</em></p>\n<p>As a part of the action used to cast this power, you must make a ranged force attack with a lightweapon or vibroweapon against one target within the power's range, otherwise the power fails. On a hit, the target takes [[/r 6d8]] damage of the same type as the weapon's damage and must make a Constitution saving throw against an additional effect depending on your choice of casting ability:</p>\n<p><strong><em>Wisdom.</em></strong> The target takes an additional [[/r 4d6]] force damage and it gains four levels of slowed until the end of its next turn. On a success, the target takes half as much damage and its speed isn't reduced.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Charisma.</em></strong> The target takes an additional [[/r 4d6]] necrotic damage and cannot regain hit points until the end of its next turn. On a success, the target takes half as much damage and its healing capability is unaffected.</p>\n<p>The weapon then immediately returns to your hand.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Force Potency.</em></strong> When you cast this power using a force slot of 6th level or higher, the force or necrotic damage increases by [[/r 1d6]] for each slot above 5th.</p>",
