      "value": "<p>Your arcane research and the magic bestowed on you by your patron have given you facility with powers.</p>\n<h5>At-Wills</h5>\n<p>You know two at-wills of your choice from the warlock power list. You learn additional warlock at-wills of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the At-Wills Known column of the Warlock table.</p>\n<h5>Power Slots</h5>\n<p>The Warlock table shows how many power slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your power slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock powers of 1st level or higher, you must expend a power slot. You regain all expended power slots when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<p>For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level power slots. To cast the 1st-level power thunderwave, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level power.</p>\n<h5>Powers Known of 1st Level and Higher</h5>\n<p>At 1st level, you know two 1st-level powers of your choice from the warlock power list.</p>\n<p>The Powers Known column of the Warlock table shows when you learn more warlock powers of your choice of 1st level and higher. A power you choose must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new warlock power, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.</p>\n<p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warlock powers you know and replace it with another power from the warlock power list, which also must be of a level for which you have power slots.</p>\n<h5>Powercasting Ability</h5>\n<p>Charisma is your powercasting ability for your warlock powers, so you use your Charisma whenever a power refers to your powercasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p><strong>Power save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>\n<p><strong>Power attack modifier </strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>\n<h5>Powercasting Focus</h5>\n<p>You can use an arcane focus as a powercasting focus for your warlock powers.</p>",
