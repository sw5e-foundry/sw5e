      "value": "<p>Also at 1st tier, when a crew member at the helm rolls for initiative, they can immediately move the ship. This movement happens before the initiative order is determined.</p><p>The amount the ship moves is determined by rolling an Evasive Maneuvers die, which is a [[/r 1d4]], and multiplying it by 50 feet. The ship then gains that many feet that it can move or spend to turn.</p><p>Your ship's Evasive Maneuvers die changes when it reaches certain tiers. The die becomes a [[/r 1d6]] at 2nd tier, a [[/r 1d8]] at 3rd tier, a [[/r 1d10]] at 4th tier, and a [[/r 1d12]] at 5th tier.</p><p>This feature can be used a number of times equal to 2 x your ship's tier. All expended uses are regained when the ship is refitted.</p>",
