      "value": "<p>For the duration, you can detect electronic transmissions. When you cast the power and as your action on each turn until the power ends, you can focus on any one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature you choose does not possess a commlink, or is not a droid or construct, the creature is unaffected.</p>\n<p>If the creature possesses a commlink or other communications device, you receive any transmissions it broadcasts or receives for the duration.</p>\n<p>Additionally, if the target is a droid or construct, you can read its \"thoughts.\" You initially learn the surface thoughts of the creatureâ€”what is most on its mind in that moment. As an action, you can either shift your attention to another creature's thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the same creature's mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), and something that looms large in its mind (such as its current objectives). If it succeeds, the power ends. Either way, the target (or its pilot, if it has one) knows that you are probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another creature's thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check contested by your Intelligence check; if it succeeds, the power ends.</p>\n<p>Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this power is particularly effective as part of an interrogation.</p>\n<p>You can also use this power to detect the presence of droids, constructs, or creatures bearing communications devices you can't see. When you cast the power or as your action during the duration, you can search for transmissions within 30 feet of you. The power can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you.</p>\n<p>Once you detect the presence of a creature in this way, you can read its thoughts or transmissions for the rest of the duration as described above, even if you can't see it, but it must still be within range.</p>",
