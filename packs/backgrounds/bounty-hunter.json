Unlike some people who collect bounties, though, you aren't a savage who follows quarry into or through the wilderness. You're involved in a lucrative trade, in the place where you live, that routinely tests your skills and survival instincts. What's more, you aren't alone, as a bounty hunter in the wild would be: you routinely interact with both the criminal subculture and other bounty hunters, maintaining contacts in both areas to help you succeed.</p>\n<p>You might be a cunning thief-catcher, prowling the rooftops to catch one of the myriad burglars of the city. Perhaps you are someone who has your ear to the street, aware of the doings of street gangs. You might be a \"velvet mask\" bounty hunter, one who blends in with high society and noble circles in order to catch the criminals that prey on the rich, whether pickpockets or con artists. As a member of an adventuring party, you might find it more difficult to pursue a personal agenda that doesn't fit with the group's objectives - but on the other hand, you can take down much more formidable targets with the help of your companions.</p>\n\t<p></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"background\">\n\t<p><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> Choose two from Deception, Insight, Persuasion, and Stealth</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"background\">\n\t<p><strong>Tool Proficiencies:</strong> Your choice of demolitions kit, security kit, or slicer's kit</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"background\">\n\t<p><strong>Languages:</strong> One of your choice</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"background\">\n\t<p><strong>Equipment:</strong> A set of clothes appropriate to your duties, a set of binders, and a pouch containing 200 cr</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"background\"><h2>Feature: Ear to the Ground</h2></div>\n<div class=\"background\"><p>You are in frequent contact with people in the segment of society that your chosen quarries move through.
