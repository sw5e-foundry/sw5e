Before becoming an adventurer you resided over a court or tribunal, managing proceedings and sentencing criminals to punishments fit for their crimes. Your job required a deep understanding of the law which you used to resolve conflicts both clear-cut and morally grey.</p>\n<p>The legal system on the planet where you worked has a large effect on how you view the law. Was it a court system with a jury making the final verdict, or did you have absolute authority over determining guilt and sentencing? Was it a fair legal system with plenty of integrity, or was it rife with abuse and corruption? Did you work on criminal cases, civil law, or something even more specific? Perhaps instead of working for a government you were a judge in an internal tribunal for a temple or military organization. </p>\n<p>Consider what compelled you to leave your old occupation behind and begin adventuring. Perhaps you seek to bring someone beyond the scope of law to justice, or maybe you have lost faith in the legal system altogether and have turned to a vigilante approach. </p>\n\t<p></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"background\">\n\t<p><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> Choose two from Insight, Investigation, Performance, and Persuasion</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"background\">\n\t<p><strong>Languages:</strong> Two of your choice</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"background\">\n\t<p><strong>Equipment:</strong> Documentation of your station, a book of law, a formal uniform you wear to court, a set of common clothes, and a belt pouch containing 100 cr.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"background\"><h2>Feature: Legal Authority</h2></div>\n<div class=\"background\"><p>You are familiar with the letter of the law and workings of courts, at least on the planet that you were a judge in. If you are in a foreign place where you are not familiar with their exact laws, you often will be able to track down the resources you need to learn them. \nIf you or your party gets into legal trouble, your experience may help you get out of it. If you can prove your credentials, you might be able to represent your party in a court of law without admonishment. You may know of legal loopholes that will help your case. If you are in the region where you originally worked, you might have past connections with many legal professionals there.\n</p></div><h2>Background Feat</h2>\n<p>\n\tAs a further embodiment of the experience and training of your background, you can choose from the\n\tfollowing feats:\n</p>\n<div class=\"smalltable\">\n\t<p>\n\t\t</p><table><thead><tr><th>[[/r d8 # Feat]]</th><th>Feat</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class=\"rows\"><th>1</th><th>@Compendium[sw5e.feats.0ouvGghIhtufl2a9]{Empathic}</th></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><th>2</th><th>@Compendium[sw5e.feats.4O9ON0Km4QZ2ogZu]{Investigator}</th></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><th>3</th><th>@Compendium[sw5e.feats.17gBRGzWPRJiQvTs]{Performer}</th></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><th>4</th><th>@Compendium[sw5e.feats.04ClTUSqxi574Xpe]{Charmer}</th></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><th>5</th><th>@Compendium[sw5e.feats.bqcghDqZHiXg1VqF]{Linguist}</th></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><th>6</th><th>@Compendium[sw5e.feats.VA4akALkS1kB8a7Z]{Actor}</th></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><th>7</th><th>@Compendium[sw5e.feats.7diQN6VoqJhyYGtA]{Observant}</th></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><th>8</th><th>@Compendium[sw5e.feats.bP2iKrNSUJyxFyMH]{Keen mind}</th></tr></tbody></table>\n\t<p></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"background\"><h2>Suggested Characteristics</h2></div>\n<div class=\"medtable\">\n\t<p>\n\t\t</p><table><thead><tr><th>[[/r d8 # Personality Trait]]</th><th>Personality Trait</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class=\"rows\"><th>1</th><th>I quote the law like a religious fanatic quotes scripture.</th></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><th>2</th><th>I bang my weapon like a gavel whenever I want a rowdy group's attention.</th></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><th>3</th><th>I remain impartial when making decisions, even when I should have biases and loyalties.</th></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><th>4</th><th>Evidence is necessary to back up any claim.</th></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><th>5</th><th>I insist on settling all party disagreements through fake court proceedings.</th></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><th>6</th><th>I have to hear all sides of a story, but I secretly hate listening to people whine about how unfairly they're treated.</th></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><th>7</th><th>I am happy to make sacrifices for the sake of fairness.</th></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><th>8</th><th>I will not attack a person unless someone can prove they are doing something wrong.</th></tr></tbody></table>\n\t<p></p>\n</div>\n<p> </p><div class=\"medtable\">\n\t<p>\n\t\t</p><table><thead><tr><th>[[/r d6 # Ideal]]</th><th>Ideal</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class=\"rows\"><th>1</th><th>Law: I will follow the letter of the law always, no matter what I believe.
