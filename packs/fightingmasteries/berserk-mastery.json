If you would already have advantage, you can instead reroll one of the dice once.</li>\n<li>You have advantage on saving throws that would force you to act against your will, be frightened, or prevent you from attacking a creature.</li>\n<li>When a creature within 5 feet of you deals damage to you with a weapon or unarmed strike, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack or unarmed strike against that creature. On a hit, you deal additional damage equal to your proficiency bonus.</li></ul>",
