When installed it comes fully stocked with blaster pistols, blaster rifles, techblades, and vibroblades, as well as combat suits, mesh armor, battle armor, and light and medium shields.</p><p>The armory is also equipped with both a key and a code lock. The armory can be accessed with a DC 20 Intelligence (Security Kit) check. When the armory is accessed, an alarm sounds in the Bridge and Security Suite (if it exists). If a player rolls a 25 or higher on the Intelligence (Security Kit) check to unlock the armory, or has the key or code, the alarm can be bypassed.</p><p>Additionally, it comes with a number of weapon training simulators equal to one-fourth the ship's suite capacity by size (minimum of one), as shown in the Starship Size Suite Capacity table.<br />Lastly, when a creature completes a long rest involving this suite, they gain advantage on the first attack roll they make before the start of their next long rest.</p>",
