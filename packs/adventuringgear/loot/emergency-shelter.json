      "value": "<p>This shelter comes packed in a 2-foot-long tube. When activated, the shelter deploys, expanding to full size in 1 minute. The shelter is 8 feet long, 8 feet wide, and 6 feet tall, and can house up to six Medium creatures. The shelter includes spikes that automatically mount to the ground, provided they can find purchase. The shelter comes with an integrated power generator, faint glowing lights in the interior which provide dim light, and creatures in the shelter are protected from the elements, including hot and cold climates, as described in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide. The shelter's power generator lasts for seven days, after which it stops providing light. The shelter can be collapsed and restored over the course of 10 minutes.</p>",
