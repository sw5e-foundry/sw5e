      "value": "<h2>Biology and Appearance</h2>\n<p>Zeltrons are one of the few near-human species that differentiated from the baseline stock enough to be considered a new species of the Human genus, rather than simply a subspecies. They possess two biological traits of note. The first is that they all produce potent pheromones, similar to the Falleen species, which enhanced their attractiveness and likeability. The second is a limited telepathic ability, used to project emotions onto others, as well as allowing them to read and even feel the emotions of others; some Zeltrons have been hired by the Exchange for this ability. Because of their telepathic ability, positive emotions such as happiness, love and pleasure are very important to them, while negative ones such as anger, fear, or depression are shunned.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Zeltron culture is highly influenced by sexuality and the pursuit of pleasure in general. Most of their art and literature is devoted to the subject, producing some of the raciest pieces in the galaxy. Zeltrons are known to dress in wildly colorful or revealing attire. It's common to see Zeltrons wearing shockingly bright shades of neon colors in wildly designed bikinis, or nearly skin tight clothing of other sorts with bizarre color designs, patterns, and symbols. </p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Zeltron names often have an air of mystique to them, to evoke sensuality. For a Zeltron, a beautiful face is nothing without an equally beautiful name. It's not uncommon for a Zeltron to forsake their familial surname in favor of a more attractive-sounding one.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Marruc, Bahb, Rahulh, Demagol </p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Lyshaa, Dani, Vianna, Chantique </p>\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> D'Pow, Blue, Duare, Sapphire</p>",
