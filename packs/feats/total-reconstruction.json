While repaired in a similar configuration as your own species, you are subject to the following changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Increase an ability score of your choice by 1, to a maximum of 20.</li>\n<li>Choose one class of droid (class I-V or tracker). You count as the chosen creature type in addition to your other type.</li>\n<li>You are resistant to necrotic and poison damage, and are immune to poison and disease.</li>\n<li>You do not need to eat or drink. Additionally, you no longer require a tech focus to cast tech powers.</li>\n<li>You are vulnerable to ion damage. Additionally, you have disadvantage on saving throws against effects that would deal ion or lightning damage.</li>\n<li>You can not sense the Force, use force powers, or take levels in forcecasting classes.</li>\n<li>You are no longer a valid target for cybernetic augmentations or genetic mutations. However, you are now a valid target for droid customizations.</li></ul>",
