Recreational areas are equipped with integrated artist's implements, gaming sets, musical instruments, and writer's implements.</p><p>While making a check with any of these tools in a recreational area, you can add your proficiency bonus to checks you make if you do not already do so. If you already add your proficiency bonus to checks you make, you instead add double your proficiency bonus. If you already double your proficiency bonus to checks you make, you instead add half of your governing ability modifier (rounded down, minimum of +1), in addition to your ability modifier.</p><p>Additionally, while utilizing any of these tools, you gain a benefit based on which tools you are using:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Gaming set or musical instrument: </strong><span style=\"font-family:'Open Sans', sans-serif\">While playing one of the gaming sets or musical instruments, you can always readily read the emotions of those paying attention to you. During this time, and for up to one minute after completing, you have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks to read the emotions of those you performed for or competed against.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Artist's implements or writer's implements:</strong> <span style=\"font-family:'Open Sans', sans-serif\">While crafting with these implements, the total market value you can craft per day increases by an amount of credits equal to 5 x your character level. If you add double your proficiency bonus to checks you make with them, the market value increases by 10 x your character level.</span></p></li></ul><p></p><p><span style=\"font-family:'Open Sans', sans-serif\">Lastly, when a creature completes a long rest involving this suite, they gain advantage on the first ability check they make before the start of their next long rest.</span></p>",
