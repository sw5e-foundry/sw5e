      "value": "<p>You have proficiency with artisan's tools (tinker's tools). Using those tools, you can spend 1 hour and 10 gp worth of materials to construct a Tiny clockwork device (AC 5, 1 hp). The device ceases to function after 24 hours (unless you spend 1 hour repairing it to keep the device functioning), or when you use your action to dismantle it; at that time, you can reclaim the materials used to create it. You can have up to three such devices active at a time. When you create a device, choose one of the following options:</p>\n<p><em>Clockwork Toy:</em> This toy is a clockwork animal, monster, or person, such as a frog, mouse, bird, dragon, or soldier. When placed on the ground, the toy moves 5 feet across the ground on each of your turns in a random direction. It makes noises as appropriate to the creature it represents.</p>\n<p><em>Fire Starter:</em> The device produces a miniature flame, which you can use to light a candle, torch, or campfire. Using the device requires your action.</p>\n<p><em>Music Box:</em> When opened, this music box plays a single song at a moderate volume. The box stops playing when it reaches the song's end or when it is closed.</p>",
