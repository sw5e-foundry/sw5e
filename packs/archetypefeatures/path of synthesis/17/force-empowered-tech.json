      "value": "<p><em><strong>Path of Synthesis:</strong> 7th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level</em></p>\n<p>You learn to fully blend your technological aptitude with your use of the Force. You have three such effects: Disruption Pulse, Force Override, and Techcasting Insight. When you use your Force-Empowered Tech, you choose which effect to create.</p>\n<p>You can use this feature three times. You gain an additional use at 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<h3>Disruption Pulse</h3>\n<p>As an action, you can send out a 30 foot cone of electromagnetically-charged energy to overload enemy weapons. Each creature within the cone that is wearing or carrying a weapon with electric components must make an Intelligence saving throw. If the weapon is being worn, this save is made with disadvantage. On a failed save, the first attack they attempt to make with that weapon has disadvantage. A creature with multiple weapons must make a separate save for each weapon.</p>\n<h3>Forced Override</h3>\n<p>When you cast a tech power that requires a saving throw, you can impose disadvantage on the save (no action required).</p>\n<h3>Techcasting Insight</h3>\n<p>As an action, you can attempt to determine another creature's experience with techcasting. When you do so, you make an Intelligence (Technology) check contested by the target's Intelligence (Technology) check. If you succeed, you immediately learn the target's techcasting Max Power Level, as well as any tech powers currently affecting the target.</p>",
