      "value": "<p><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Improved Force Immunity</em></p>\n<p>A 10-foot-radius faintly shimmering barrier surrounds you. Within the sphere, powers can't be cast and enhanced items become mundane. Until the power ends, the sphere moves with you, centered on you.</p>\n<p>Powers and other enhanced effects are suppressed in the sphere and can't protrude into it. A slot expended to cast a suppressed power is consumed. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn't function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Targeted Effects.</em></strong> Powers and other enhanced effects that target a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect on that target.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Enhanced Areas.</em></strong> The area of another power or enhanced effect, such as <em>force storm</em>, can't extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an enhanced area, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Powers.</em></strong> Any active power or other enhanced effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Enhanced Items.</em></strong> The properties and powers of enhanced items are suppressed in the sphere. For example, a +1 vibrosword in the sphere functions as an unenhanced vibrosword.</p>\n<p>An enhanced weapon's properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If an enhanced weapon or a piece of enhanced ammunition fully leaves the sphere (for example, if you fire an enhanced shot or throw an enhanced saberspear at a target outside the sphere), the enhancement of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Enhanced Travel.</em></strong> Teleportation fails to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the departure point for such enhanced travel. A portal to another location temporarily closes while in the sphere.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Creatures and Objects.</em></strong> A creature or object summoned or created by powers temporarily winks out of existence in the sphere. Such a creature instantly reappears once the space the creature occupied is no longer within the sphere.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Tech Override/Sever Force.</em></strong> Powers and enhanced effects such as <em>sever force</em> have no effect on the sphere. Likewise, the spheres created by different scrambling field powers don't nullify each other.</p>",
