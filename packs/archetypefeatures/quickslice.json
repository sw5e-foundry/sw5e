      "value": "<p><strong><em>Cybertech Engineering:</em></strong><em> 6th level</em> </p>\n<p>When a creature you can see casts a tech power, you may use your reaction to attempt to download that tech power to your wristpad for later use if it is of a level for which you can cast. </p>\n<p>Make an ability check using your techcasting ability with proficiency. The DC equals 10 + two times the power's level. On a success you store the power for later use. On a failure, the power is not stored. You can cast powers stored in your wristpad as if you had learned them and they do not count against your tech powers known.</p>\n<p>Once you have used this feature on a creature, you cannot do so again on the same creature until you complete a short or long rest.</p>\n<p>You can store an amount of levels worth of tech powers equal to your engineer level at a time. Additionally, you can choose replace or remove one or more tech powers learned by this feature each time you use it.</p>",
