Until the power ends, dim light fills the cylinder.</p><p>When a creature enters the power's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it is engulfed in ghostly flames that cause searing pain, and it must make a Constitution saving throw. It takes 2d10 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p><p>A Shapechanger makes its saving throw with disadvantage. If it fails, it also instantly reverts to its original form and can't assume a different form until it leaves the power's light.</p><p>On each of your turns after you cast this power, you can use an action to move the beam up to 60 feet in any direction.</p><p><strong>At Higher Levels</strong>. When you cast this power using a power slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 2nd.</p>",
