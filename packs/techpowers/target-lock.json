Until the power ends, you deal an extra [[/r 1d6]] damage to the target whenever you hit it with a weapon attack, the target gains no benefit from one-quarter, half, and three-quarters cover against you, and if the target is invisible, you can see it as if it were visible. If the target drops to 0 hit points before this power ends, you can use a bonus action on a subsequent turn of yours to mark a new creature.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Overcharge Tech.</em></strong> When you cast this power using a tech slot of 3rd or 4th level, you can maintain your concentration on the power for up to 8 hours.
