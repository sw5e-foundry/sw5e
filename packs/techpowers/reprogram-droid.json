The droid must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by you for the duration. While the droid is charmed by you, it takes [[/r 5d10]] lightning damage each time it acts in a manner directly counter to your instructions, but it can only do so once each day.</p>\n<p>You can issue any command you choose, short of an activity that would result in certain death. Should you issue a suicidal command, the power ends. You can end the power early by using an action to dismiss it. The <em>remove virus</em> power also ends it.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Overcharge Tech.</em></strong> When you cast this power using a tech slot of 7th or 8th level, the duration is 1 year. When you cast this power using a tech slot of 9th level, the power lasts until it is ended by <em>remove virus</em>.</p>",
