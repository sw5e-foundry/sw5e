      "value": "<p>You enhance your shot with armor-piercing properties. When you use this option, you don't make an attack roll for the attack. Instead, the shot shoots forward in a line, which is 1 foot wide and 30 feet long, before disappearing. The shot passes through objects, ignoring cover. Each creature in that line must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes damage as if it were hit by the shot, plus an extra [[/r 1d6]] damage of the weapon's type. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage.</p>\n<p>The extra damage increases to [[/r 2d6]] when you reach 18th level in this class.</p>",
