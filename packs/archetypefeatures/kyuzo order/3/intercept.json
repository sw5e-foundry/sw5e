      "value": "<p><em><strong>Kyuzo Order:</strong> 3rd level</em></p>\n<p>You gain proficiency in vibroweapons with the thrown property and they become monk weapons for you. Additionally, when you throw an improvised weapon, you are considered proficient in it, and it uses your Martial Arts die instead of its [[/r 1d4]]. </p>\n<p>Additionally, you've learned to use thrown weapons to intercept projectiles traveling towards your allies. When you are wielding a weapon with which you are proficient, and a creature within your weapon's normal thrown range is hit by a ranged attack, you can use your reaction to throw your weapon to intercept the projectile. When you do so, the damage the creature takes from the attack is reduced by [[/r 1d10]] + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level. If the weapon has the returning property, it then returns to your hand.</p>",
