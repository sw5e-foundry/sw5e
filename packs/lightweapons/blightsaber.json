      "value": "<h3>Corruption 13</h3>\n<p>This weapon's damage becomes necrotic, and it loses the luminous property if it has it. Additionally, when you would make a melee weapon attack with a weapon with the corruption property, you can instead force the target to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + your bonus to attacks with the weapon, or the corruption number, whichever is lower). If you would have advantage on your attack roll, the creature instead has disadvantage on their saving throw, and if you would have disadvantage on your attack roll, the creature instead has advantage on their saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes normal weapon damage and is subjected to any additional effects that would occur on a hit, and the creature cannot regain hit points until the start of your next turn.</p>\n<h3>Hidden</h3>\n<p>You have advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks made to conceal a weapon with this property.</p>\n<h3>Versatile ([[/r 2d4]])</h3>\n<p>A weapon with this property can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the propertyâ€”the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.\t</p>",
