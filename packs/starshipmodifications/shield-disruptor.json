      "value": "<p><span style=\"font-family:'Open Sans', sans-serif\">This modification adds a shield disruptor to a ship, which is used to interfere with another ship's shield. As an action, a crewmember can activate the shield disruptor and choose a ship they can see within 1,000 feet. You make a Charisma (Interfere) check contested by the target's Constitution (Regulate) check. On a failed save, the ship's shield regeneration rate is reduced by half for 1 minute. Additionally they take damage to their shields equal to two of their shield dice.</span></p><p>At the start of each of the target ship's turns, a crewmember can use an action to repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.</p><p>If a ship is targeted by a larger ship, it has disadvantage on the saving throw. If targeted by a smaller ship, it instead has advantage.</p><p>You can end the shield disruptor at any time (no action required). This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier. All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.</p>",
