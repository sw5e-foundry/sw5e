      "value": "<p><span style=\"font-family:'Open Sans', sans-serif\">The {creature} creates a whirlpool in the water at a point it can see within 30 feet. The whirlpool is a 30-feet deep cylinder with a 10-foot radius centered on that point. On subsequent turns, the {creature} can use its Whirlpool action again to maintain and move the whirlpool up to 30 feet in any direction along the surface of the water. The whirlpool sucks up any medium or smaller objects that aren't secured to anything and that aren't worn or carried by anyone.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:'Open Sans', sans-serif\">A creature must make a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw when it enters the whirlpool's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there. A creature takes 27 (6d8) kinetic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In addition, a Large or smaller creature that fails the save must succeed on a DC 21 Strength saving throw or become restrained in the whirlpool until the power ends.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:'Open Sans', sans-serif\">When a creature starts its turn restrained by the whirlpool, the creature is pulled 5 feet deeper inside it, unless the creature is at the bottom. A restrained creature moves with the whirlpool and is submerged when the effect ends, unless the creature has some means to stay afloat. A restrained creature can use an action to make a DC 21 Strength or Dexterity check. If successful, the creature is no longer restrained by the whirlpool and is hurled [[/r 3d6x10]] feet away from it in a random direction. The whirlpool lasts for one round. The aqua monster can repeat the legendary action again to maintain the whirlpool.</span></p>",
