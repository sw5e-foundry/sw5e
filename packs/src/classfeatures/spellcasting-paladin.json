      "value": "<p>By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divine magic through meditation and prayer to cast powers as a cleric does.</p>\n<h3>Preparing and Casting Powers</h3>\n<p>The Paladin table shows how many power slots you have to cast your powers. To cast one of your paladin powers of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the power's level or higher. You regain all expended power slots when you finish a long rest.</p><p>You prepare the list of paladin powers that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin power list. When you do so, choose a number of paladin powers equal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one power). The powers must be of a level for which you have power slots.</p><p>For example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level power slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared powers can include four powers of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level power cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2ndlevel slot. Casting the power doesn't remove it from your list of prepared powers.</p><p>You can change your list of prepared powers when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin powers requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per power level for each power on your list.</p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td rowspan=\"2\">Level</td>\n<td colspan=\"5\">-&nbsp; Power Slots per Power Level&nbsp; -</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1st</td>\n<td>2nd</td>\n<td>3rd</td>\n<td>4th</td>\n<td>5th</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1st</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2nd</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3rd</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4th</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Powercasting Ability</h3>\n<p>Charisma is your powercasting ability for your paladin powers, since their power derives from the strength of your convictions.
