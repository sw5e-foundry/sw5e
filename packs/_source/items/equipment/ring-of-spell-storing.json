      "value": "<p><em>(Requires attunement)</em></p>\n<p>This ring stores powers cast into it, holding them until the attuned wearer uses them. The ring can store up to 5 levels worth of powers at a time. When found, it contains 1d6 âˆ’ 1 levels of stored powers chosen by the GM.</p>\n<p>Any creature can cast a power of 1st through 5th level into the ring by touching the ring as the power is cast. The power has no effect, other than to be stored in the ring. If the ring can't hold the power, the power is expended without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the power determines how much space it uses.</p>\n<p>While wearing this ring, you can cast any power stored in it. The power uses the slot level, power save DC, power attack bonus, and powercasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the power. The power cast from the ring is no longer stored in it, freeing up space.</p>",
