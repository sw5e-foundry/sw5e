      "value": "<p>Also at 1st tier, your starship gains the ability to slip underneath the shields of an enemy ship.</p><p>When your ship occupies the same square occupied by a target ship and the crew member at the helm makes an attack roll, as a reaction, they can, before rolling the attack, roll a Pinpoint Strike die, which is a [[/r 1d4]], and add it to the attack roll. If the attack requires a saving throw instead, you may subtract the Pinpoint Strike die from the target's save result. On a hit or a failed save, the attack deals normal damage that bypasses any shields and directly hits the hull of the target ship. This feature can only be used once per round.</p><p>Your ship's Pinpoint Strike die changes when it reaches certain tiers. The die becomes a [[/r 1d6]] at 2nd tier, a [[/r 1d8]] at 3rd tier, a [[/r 1d10]] at 4th tier, and a [[/r 1d12]] at 5th tier.</p><p>This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier. All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.</p>",
