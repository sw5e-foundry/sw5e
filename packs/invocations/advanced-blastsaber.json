As an action, you can disable a single electronic device not being worn or held by another creature within 5 feet of you. The device is then disabled until it is rebooted.</p>\n<p>Additionally, when you activate this conversion to alter the properties of your lightweapon, you create a projected barrier of ion energy in a 10-foot-radius sphere around you until the start of your next turn. Hostile creatures treat this area as difficult terrain. When a hostile creature enters the shielded area or starts its turn there, that creature takes [[/r 3d4]] ion damage. Any electronics not being worn or held within the barrier's radius are disabled until rebooted.</p>",
