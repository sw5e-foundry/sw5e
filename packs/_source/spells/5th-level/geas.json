While the creature is charmed by you, it takes 5d10 psychic damage each time it acts in a manner directly counter to your instructions, but no more than once each day. A creature that can't understand you is unaffected by the power.</p><p>You can issue any command you choose, short of an activity that would result in certain death. Should you issue a suicidal command, the power ends.</p><p>You can end the power early by using an action to dismiss it. A Remove Curse, Greater Restoration, or wish power also ends it.</p><p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this power using a power slot of 7th or 8th level, the Duration is 1 year. When you cast this power using a power slot of 9th level, the power lasts until it is ended by one of the Powers mentioned above.</p>",
