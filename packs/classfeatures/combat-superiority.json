      "value": "<p><em><strong>Fighter:</strong> 2nd level</em></p>\n<p>You learn maneuvers that are fueled by special dice called superiority dice. See chapter 13 for the maneuvers list.</p>\n<h3>Maneuvers Known</h3>\n<p>You learn one maneuver of your choice, and you earn more at higher levels, as shown in the Maneuvers Known column of the fighter table. Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one maneuver per attack, and you may only use each maneuver once per turn.</p>\n<p>Each time you learn new maneuvers, you can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one.</p>\n<h3>Superiority Dice</h3>\n<p>You have two superiority dice, which are d4s, and you earn more at higher levels, as shown in the Superiority Dice Quantity column of the fighter table. This die changes as you gain fighter levels, as shown in the Superiority Dice Size column of the fighter table. A superiority die is expended when you use it. </p>\n<p>You regain all of your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<h3>Maneuver Ability</h3>\n<p>Your maneuver ability varies based on the type of the maneuver you use. You use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution for physical maneuvers (your choice), Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma for mental maneuvers (your choice), and an ability of your choice for general maneuvers. You use this ability whenever a maneuver refers to your maneuver ability. Additionally, you use this ability modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a maneuver you use.</p>\n<p><em></em>_</p>\n<p><strong>Maneuver save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your maneuver ability modifier</p>\n<p><em></em>_</p>",
