      "value": "<h2>Biology and Appearance</h2>\n<p>The gormak are green humanoids with flat, noseless faces adorned with frills, collecting in whorls on the sides of their heads. They have clawed, three-fingered, frilled hands, and tend to possess a muscular build. Females are slightly shorter than males and lacked a whorl located above their nose. </p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>An aggressive species, the gormak hold an innate love of warfare and competition, and are extremely hostile towards the other natives of their planet, the voss. The gormak hold a belief that in order for them to prosper, the voss, whom they view as a plague on the planet, must be destroyed. To achieve that goal, warriors have repeatedly assaulted the voss capital city over the course of centuries; however, despite their far greater numbers, their nature has kept them from uniting against their enemy. While their society and speech are considered primitive by galactic standards, their innate talent with technology rivals the top minds of the galaxy. From bits of scavenged electronics and equipment, the gormak construct advanced tools, heavy machinery, specialized weapons and even cybernetic implants. However, despite their incredible affinity for technology, the gormak remain a pre-spaceflight culture confined to their homeworld, which causes them to be viewed as a backward species despite being perfectly capable of repairing, modifying and improving tech created by more advanced cultures. </p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Gormak are commonly named after heroes of their history by local shamans. Surnames are tribe-based, but optional. </p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Damal, Henet, Wockuss, Yryu, Zenit</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Finay, Heidith, Jhekon, Rakva, Sanas</p>\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> -Du, -Fo, -Qa, -Ry, -Ve</p>",
