      "value": "<p>You learn an exploit that enhances your ability to apply your knowledge to combat situations. You can take this exploit multiple times.</p>\n<p>When you take the Attack action, you can use one of your skill exploits granted by this feature. You can use these features a combined two times. You gain an additional use at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p>Choose from the following. You must be proficient in the skill in order to take that skill's exploit. </p>\n<p><strong><em>Aim (Stealth).</em></strong> You attempt to line up a strike against a creature you can see that you are hidden from. Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check contested by the target's Wisdom (Perception) check. If your check succeeds, you gain a +10 bonus to the first attack roll you make against the target before the end of your next turn. If your check fails, you are no longer hidden from the target.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Angle (Perception).</em></strong> You attempt to predict the behavior of a humanoid you can see within 30 feet. Make a Wisdom (Perception) check contested by the target's Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. If your check succeeds, the first attack roll the target makes before the start of your next turn has disadvantage, and the first saving throw the creature makes before the start of your next turn has disadvantage. If your check fails, you can't use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Battle Cry (Intimidation).</em></strong> You attempt to demoralize one humanoid you can see within 30 feet of you that can see and hear you. Make a Charisma (Intimidation) check contested by the target's Wisdom (Insight) check. If your check succeeds, the target is frightened until the end of your next turn. If the target was already frightened of you, it must immediately drop whatever it is holding. On its next turn, if it is still frightened of you, it must take the Dash action and move away from you by the safest available route on its turn, unless there is nowhere to move. If your check fails, you can't use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Charm (Persuasion).</em></strong> You attempt to convince one humanoid you can see within 30 feet that can hear and understand you. Make a Charisma (Persuasion) check contested by the target's Wisdom (Insight) check. If you have dealt damage to the creature in the last hour, it has advantage on the check. If your check succeeds, the target is charmed by you until the start of your next turn, and it has disadvantage on the first attack roll it makes against a creature before the end of its next turn. If your check fails, you can't use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Confuse Beast (Animal Handling).</em></strong> You attempt to confuse one beast on the battlefield. Make a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check contested by the target's Wisdom (Insight) check. If your check succeeds, the beast cannot take actions or reactions until the end of your next turn. If your check fails, you can't use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Distract (Performance).</em></strong> You attempt to distract one beast or humanoid you can see within 30 feet of you that can see and hear you. Make a Charisma (Performance) check contested by the target's Wisdom (Insight) check. If your check succeeds, the next attack roll made against the target before the start of its next turn has advantage. If your check fails, you can't use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Emulate Predator (Nature).</em></strong> You attempt to emulate the sounds of a natural predator of a beast or plant you can see within 30 feet. Make an Intelligence (Nature) check contested by the target's Wisdom (Insight) check. If your check succeeds, the target must take the Dash action and move away from you by the safest available route on its turn, unless there is nowhere to move. If your check fails, you can't use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Feint (Deception).</em></strong> You attempt to divert the attention of a target you can see within 30 feet. Make a Charisma (Deception) check contested by the target's Wisdom (Insight) check. If your check succeeds, the first attack roll made against the target before the start of </p>\n<p>your next turn by someone other than you has advantage, and the target has disadvantage on the first saving throw they make against an effect caused by a creature other than you before the start of your next turn. If your check fails, the target can't be deceived by you in this way for 1 hour.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Hacktivate (Technology).</em></strong> You attempt to determine the weaknesses in a droid you can see within 30 feet. Make an Intelligence (Technology) check contested by the target's Intelligence (Technology) check. If your check succeeds, you have advantage on the next attack roll you make against the target before the end of your turn, and if you hit, you deal additional damage equal to your Intelligence modifier. If your check fails, you can't use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Instruct (Investigation).</em></strong> You attempt to find a weakness in your target. Make an Intelligence (Investigation) check contested by the target's Charisma (Deception) check. If your check succeeds, if a friendly creature makes an attack roll against the target and they can see and hear you, you can use your reaction to grant them advantage on the roll. If you do so, and they hit, they deal additional damage equal to your bonus to Investigation checks. This damage is the same type as the attack's damage. If your check fails, you can't use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Intuit (Insight).</em></strong> You attempt to determine the motivations of one humanoid you can see within 30 feet. Make a Wisdom (Insight) check contested by the target's Charisma (Deception) check. If your check succeeds, the target can't have advantage on ability checks, attack rolls, or saving throws against you until the end of your next turn. If your check fails, the target instead can't have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, or saving throws against you until the end of your next turn.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Pocket Sand (Sleight of Hand).</em></strong> You attempt to blind one beast or humanoid you can see within 15 feet of you. Make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check contested by the target's Wisdom (Perception) check. If your check succeeds, the target is blinded until the end of your turn. If your check fails, you can't use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Precision Strike (Medicine).</em></strong> You attempt to strike a pressure point in one humanoid within your reach. Make a Wisdom (Medicine) check contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If your check succeeds, they are incapacitated until the end of their next turn. If your check fails, you can't use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Snare (Survival).</em></strong> You attempt to cause a creature within 30 feet of you to stumble. Make a Wisdom (Survival) check contested by the target's Wisdom (Perception) check. If your check succeeds, and the target moves towards you before the start of your next turn, it gains 1 slowed level, and you can use your reaction to cause it to fall prone. If your check fails, you can't use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Spin (Piloting).</em></strong> You attempt to confound a piloted construct you can see within 30 feet. Make an </p>\n<p>Intelligence (Piloting) check contested by the target's Intelligence (Piloting) check. If your check succeeds, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls against you, and you have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against the target, until the start of your next turn. If your check fails, the target instead has advantage on attack rolls against you, and you have disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws against the target, until the start of your next turn.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Study (Lore).</em></strong> You attempt to anticipate your target's action. Make an Intelligence (Lore) check contested by the target's Charisma (Deception) check. If your check succeeds, you have advantage on the first ability check, attack roll or saving throw you make against that creature before the end of your next turn. Alternatively, before the end of your next turn, you can use your reaction to grant disadvantage on the first ability check, attack roll, or saving throw the target makes against you. If your check fails, you instead have disadvantage on the first ability check, attack roll or saving throw you make against that creature before the end of your next turn.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Tumble (Acrobatics).</em></strong> You attempt to make a quick tumble, immediately moving 10 feet. If you begin or end this movement within a creature's reach, make a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by it's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If your check succeeds, this movement does not provoke opportunity attacks from it, and you have advantage on the first attack roll you make against it before the end of your turn. If your check fails, you immediately fall prone.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Wrestle (Athletics).</em></strong> You attempt to grab and pin a creature within 5 feet of you with at least one free hand. The target must be no more than one size larger than you. Make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If your check succeeds, the target is both grappled and restrained by you. If the target stops being grappled, it also stops being restrained. If your check fails, you can't use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.</p>",
