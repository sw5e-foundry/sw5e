When you would expend a use of your Psychometric Analysis, you can instead choose to target your immediate vicinity (up to a 50-foot cube) and investigate for at least 1 minute. For each minute you investigate, you see visions of recent events in the area going back a number of days equal to your scholar level, you learn about one significant event, beginning with the most recent. </p>\n<p>You can investigate in this way for a number of minutes equal to your scholar level and must maintain concentration during that time, as if you were concentrating on a power. </p>\n<p>Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you complete a short or long rest.</p>",
