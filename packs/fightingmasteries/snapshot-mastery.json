      "value": "<p>You've mastered getting up close and personal with blaster weapons, maintaining both rate of fire and accuracy. You gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your ranged weapon attacks reduce partial cover by one step (from three-quarters to half or half to one-quarter) against targets within 30 feet of you. If the target has one-quarter cover, you ignore it entirely.</li>\n<li>Other creatures provoke an opportunity attack from you when they move to within 30 feet of you, and you can make ranged weapon attacks with blaster weapons when making opportunity attacks.</li>\n<li>When you take the Attack action targeting a creature within 30 feet while you are wielding a blaster weapon with which you are proficient, you can choose to attack rapidly at the expense of accuracy. Your ranged weapon attack is made without the aid of your proficiency bonus, but you can use your bonus action to make an additional ranged weapon attack, also without your proficiency bonus. If you would make more than one attack when you take the Attack action, only one attack is made without your proficiency bonus.</li></ul>",
