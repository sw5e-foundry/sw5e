When you use this power, you can cause the weapon to move up to 20 feet and make a melee force attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. On a hit, the target takes [[/r 1d8]] + your forcecasting ability modifier damage. The type is of the normal damage dealt by the weapon.</p>\n<p>While the weapon is animated, on each of your turns you can use a bonus action to move the weapon up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. At any time, you can end this force power to return the animated weapon to your hand.</p>\n<p>An enemy can attempt to gain control of the weapon by using its action to make a Strength (Athletics) check against your force save DC. On a success, the creature gains control of the weapon and the power ends.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Force Potency.</em></strong> When you cast this power using a force slot of 3rd level or higher, the weapon's damage increases by [[/r 1d8]] for every two slot levels above 2nd.</p>",
