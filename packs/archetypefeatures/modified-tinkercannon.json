      "value": "<p><em><strong>Unstable Engineering:</strong> 3rd, 9th, and 17th level</em></p>\n<p>You learn to enhance your tinker's implements with unstable science, modifying them into a harness with a cannon. Over the course of a long rest, you can modify your tinker's implements to create a tinkercannon. You must have tinker's implements in order to perform this modification.</p>\n<p>Whenever you cast a tech power of 1st level or higher while wielding your tinkercannon, you risk unexpected complications. Your GM can have you roll a [[/r d20]]. If you roll a 1, roll on the Unstable Engineering Surge table to create a random effect. </p>\n<p>Additionally, your tinkercannon come equipped with four overrides, and they gain more at higher levels, as shown in the Modification Slots column of the engineer table. Each time you trigger an Unstable Engineering Surge, you can use an override to reroll the percentile dice. You must use the new result, you can only do this once per surge, and each time you do so in excess of your proficiency bonus (resetting on a long rest) your maximum tech points is reduced by 1 until you complete a long rest. You regain all expended overrides when you complete a long rest.</p>",
