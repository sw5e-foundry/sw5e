Before becoming an adventurer you resided over a court or tribunal, managing proceedings and sentencing criminals to punishments fit for their crimes. Your job required a deep understanding of the law which you used to resolve conflicts both clear-cut and morally grey.</p>\n<p>The legal system on the planet where you worked has a large effect on how you view the law. Was it a court system with a jury making the final verdict, or did you have absolute authority over determining guilt and sentencing? Was it a fair legal system with plenty of integrity, or was it rife with abuse and corruption? Did you work on criminal cases, civil law, or something even more specific? Perhaps instead of working for a government you were a judge in an internal tribunal for a temple or military organization. </p>\n<p>Consider what compelled you to leave your old occupation behind and begin adventuring. Perhaps you seek to bring someone beyond the scope of law to justice, or maybe you have lost faith in the legal system altogether and have turned to a vigilante approach. </p>\n\t<p></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"background\">\n\t<p><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> Choose two from Insight, Investigation, Performance, and Persuasion</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"background\">\n\t<p><strong>Languages:</strong> Two of your choice</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"background\">\n\t<p><strong>Equipment:</strong> Documentation of your station, a book of law, a formal uniform you wear to court, a set of common clothes, and a belt pouch containing 100 cr.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"background\"><h2>Feature: Legal Authority</h2></div>\n<div class=\"background\"><p>You are familiar with the letter of the law and workings of courts, at least on the planet that you were a judge in.
