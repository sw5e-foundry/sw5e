If the attack hits, the target is also swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the target is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the {creature}, and it takes <strong>21 (6d6) <em>acid damage</em></strong> at the start of each of the {creature}'s turns. A {creature} can have only one creature swallowed at a time.</p><p>If the {creature} takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from the swallowed creature, the {creature} must succeed on a  <strong>DC 14 Constitution</strong> saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the creature, which falls prone in a space within 10 ft. of the {creature}. If the {creature} dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 15 ft. of movement, exiting prone.</p>\n</section>\n<p>The {creature} attacks with its Swallow.</p>",
