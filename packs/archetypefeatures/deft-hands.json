      "value": "<p><em><strong>Acquisitions Practice:</strong> 3rd level</em></p>\n<p>You learn a number of techniques to distract and confuse your opponents. When you deal Sneak Attack damage, you may choose to forgo two of your Sneak Attack dice to perform a deft hand maneuver.</p>\n<p>Some of your deft hand maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the deft hand maneuver's effects. The saving throw DC is as follows:</p>\n<p><em></em>_</p>\n<p><strong>Deft Hands save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier</p>\n<p><em></em>_</p>\n<h3>Hinder</h3>\n<p>You attempt to distract your target in order to hinder their movement. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it gains 1 slowed level until the end of its next turn and it makes the first Dexterity saving throw before the end of its next turn with disadvantage.</p>\n<h3>Pilfer</h3>\n<p>You attempt to pick your target's pockets. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, you have advantage on the first Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check you make against the target before the end of your next turn.</p>\n<h3>Tumble</h3>\n<p>You attempt to nimbly roll away. You immediately move 10 feet in a direction of your choice, and the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, this movement does not provoke opportunity attacks from the creature.</p>",
