      "value": "<p><em><strong>Way of Endurance:</strong> 3rd level</em></p>\n<p>The Force flowing through your body strengthens you, granting the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your hit point maximum increases by 3, and it increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class.</li>\n<li>Your base AC becomes 13 + your Constitution modifier. </li>\n<li>When you make a melee weapon attack as a part of a force power you cast, you can use Wisdom or Charisma (your choice) instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additionally, as an action, you can gain resistance to kinetic and energy damage for 1 minute. This effect lasts until you end it as a bonus action, you are incapacitated, or you don armor other than a shield. You can use this feature twice. You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a short or long rest.</p>",
