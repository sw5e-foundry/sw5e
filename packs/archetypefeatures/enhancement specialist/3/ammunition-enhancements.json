Many ammunition enhancements boost an attack in some way. Once per turn when you fire a shot from a blaster as part of the Attack action, you can apply one of your Ammunition Enhancement options to that shot,</p>\n<p>You gain an additional Ammunition Enhancement option of your choice when you reach certain levels in this class: 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level. Each option also improves when you become an 18th-level fighter.</p>\n<p>Each time you learn new ammunition enhancements, you can also replace one ammunition enhancement you know with a different one.</p>",
