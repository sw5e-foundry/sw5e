Additionally, when you would make a melee weapon attack with a weapon with the bright property, you can instead force the target to make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your bonus to attacks with the weapon, or the bright number, whichever is lower). If you would have advantage on your attack roll, the creature instead has disadvantage on their saving throw, and if you would have disadvantage on your attack roll, the creature instead has advantage on their saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes normal weapon damage and is subjected to any additional effects that would occur on a hit, and the creature takes additional damage of the same type at the start of its next turn equal to your governing ability modifier.</p>"
