Over the course of a long rest, you can modify your wristpad. You must have a wristpad and cybertech's implements in order to perform this modification.</p>\n<p>Your wristpad requires attunement, can only be used by you, and counts as a tech focus for your tech powers while you are attuned to it. Your modified wristpad has 4 modification slots, and it gains more at higher levels, as shown in the Modification Slots column of the engineer table. For each modification installed in excess of your proficiency bonus, your tech point maximum is reduced by 1. Over the course of a long rest, you can install, replace, or remove a number of modifications up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one).</p>\n<p>Some modification effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your tech save DC.</p>",
