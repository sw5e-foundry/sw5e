      "value": "<p>When you move at least 150 feet towards a target, you may declare an Attack Run as an action. You must have a clear path towards your target, and nothing should hinder your path (such as difficult terrain or obstacles). If you finish this movement within range of your target, you may follow it with one of these options:</p><p><strong>Fire</strong>. You may make a ship weapon attack from a forward-facing limited arc without suffering the normal disadvantage. If you attack with a tertiary or quaternary weapon, the attack deals additional damage equal to the distance of your attack run divided by 50, up to your ship's Strength modifier (minimum of 1).</p><p><strong>Ram</strong>. You may make a Ram attempt with advantage on your Strength (Ram) check. If you succeed, the target ship takes additional damage equal to the distance of your Attack Run divided by 50, up to your ship's Constitution modifier (minimum of +1).</p>",
