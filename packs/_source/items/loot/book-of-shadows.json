While the book is on your person, you can cast those at-wills at will. They don't count against your number of at-wills known. If they don't appear on the warlock power list, they are nonetheless warlock powers for you. </p>\n<p>If you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book turns to ash when you die.</p>",
