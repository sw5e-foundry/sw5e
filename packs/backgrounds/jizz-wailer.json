You are a professional musician, versed in the improvisational style of the outer rim known as Jizz. </p>\n<p>Jizz is a melting pot of thousands of different alien musical traditions. Jizz celebrates spontaneity, groove and experimentation. It is almost always played in an ensemble band, but the instruments can vary. Knowing how to play with others, when to push and when to pull back, is the key to a good ensemble.</p>\n<p>But Jizz is more than the music. It's about wandering the galaxy and living out of a suitcase. It's about playing the sleaziest cantinas you can find and having a good time while you do it. Jizz is the music of freedom and freedom loving people. Jizz is Life and Life is Jizz.</p>\n\t<p></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"background\">\n\t<p><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> Choose two from Insight, Performance, Persuasion, and Sleight of Hand</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"background\">\n\t<p><strong>Tool Proficiencies:</strong> One type of musical instrument</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"background\">\n\t<p><strong>Languages:</strong> One of your choice</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"background\">\n\t<p><strong>Equipment:</strong> A musical instrument (one of your choice), a cool hat, a set of common clothes and a belt pouch containing 150 cr</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"background\"><h2>Feature: Steady Gig</h2></div>\n<div class=\"background\"><p>You can always find a place to perform, usually in an cantina or spice den but possibly in a fine dining establishment, culture center or even a noble—s court.

In addition, your performance makes you something of a local figure.
