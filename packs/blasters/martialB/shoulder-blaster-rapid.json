A power cell fuels a number of attacks equal to the weapon's reload number.</p>\n<h3>Rapid 4</h3>\n<p>When you would make a ranged weapon attack with a weapon with this property, you can instead unload on a single target, consuming ammunition equal to the rapid number. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your bonus to attacks with the weapon). On a failed save, roll the weapon's damage dice twice and add them together, adding relevant modifiers as normal and subjecting the target to any additional effects that would occur on a hit. If you would have advantage on your attack roll, the creature instead has disadvantage on their saving throw, and if you would have disadvantage on your attack roll, the creature instead has advantage on their saving throw.</p>\n<h3>Reload 16</h3>\n<p>A number of shots equal to the reload number can be made with a weapon with this property. A character must then reload it using an action or a bonus action (their choice). You must have one free hand to reload.</p>\n<h3>Smart (15/+2)</h3>\n<p>This weapon ignores your Dexterity score and proficiency bonus. Two numbers appear in parentheses with the propertyâ€”the first is the weapon's Dexterity score, and the second is the weapon's proficiency bonus. The weapon uses these values instead of yours when you make attack and damage rolls with it. If you lack proficiency with the weapon, the weapon does not benefit from its proficiency bonus.</p>\n<h3>Special</h3>\n<p>Mounted by the shoulder slot, a shoulder blaster does not require a free hand to use. Additionally, you have advantage on Strength ability checks and saving throws to avoid being disarmed of this weapon.</p>",
