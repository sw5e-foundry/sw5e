      "value": "<p><em><strong>Path of Witchcraft:</strong> 3rd and 11th level</em></p>\n<p>You learn to call on the spirits of beasts and grant them ichorous form. Once on each of your turns, when you cast a force power and deal necrotic damage to a creature, you can conjure a familiar within 5 feet of it (no action required). The familiar takes the form of a humanoid or beast made of green, glowing smoke, and it lasts for 1 minute, until you dismiss it as a bonus action, until you manifest another spirit, or until you're incapacitated or die.</p>\n<p>Your familiar has an AC equal to your universal force save DC, 1 hit point, and immunity to all conditions. If it has to make a saving throw, it uses your saving throw bonus for the roll. It is the same size as you regardless of its appearance, and it occupies its own space. On your turn, you can mentally command the familiar to move up to 30 feet in any direction (no action required). If your familiar is ever more than 30 feet from you at the end of your turn, it is destroyed. While you have a familiar, you gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>As a bonus action, you can use your magicks to teleport, swapping places with your familiar at a cost of 15 feet of your movement, regardless of the distance between the two of you.</li>\n<li>When you take the Attack action on your turn, any attack you make with that action can originate from your space or the familiar's space. You make this choice for each attack.</li>\n<li>When a creature that you can see within 5 feet of your familiar moves at least 5 feet away from it, you can use your reaction to make an opportunity attack against that creature as if you were in the familiar's space.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Starting at 11th level, you can summon your familiar when you deal damage with any force power, instead of just necrotic. Additionally, you can summon your familiar when you use a Force-Empowered Self option on your turn.</p>",
