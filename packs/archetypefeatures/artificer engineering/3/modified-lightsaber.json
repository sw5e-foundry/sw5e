      "value": "<p><em><strong>Artificer Engineering:</strong> 3rd and 9th level</em></p>\n<p>You learn to modify an unenhanced lightsaber utilizing your artificer knowledge. Over the course of a long rest, you can modify your lightsaber. You must have the lightsaber and artificer's implements in order to perform this modification.</p>\n<p>Your modified lightsaber is enhanced, requires attunement, can only be used by you, and counts as a tech focus for your tech powers while you are attuned to it. Your modified lightsaber has 4 modification slots, and it gains more at higher levels, as shown in the Modification Slots column of the engineer table. For each modification installed in excess of your proficiency bonus, your tech point maximum is reduced by 1. Over the course of a long rest, you can install, replace, or remove a number of modifications up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one).</p>\n<p>Some modification effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your tech save DC.</p>\n<p>At 9th level, you can maintain two different modified lightsabers. The total modification slots are split across the two items.</p>",
