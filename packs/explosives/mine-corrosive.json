      "value": "<p>Mines can be set to detonate when a creature comes within up to 15 feet of it or paired with a remote detonator. As an action, you can prime and set a mine on a surface you can reach, which arms at the start of your next turn. When detonated, each creature within 15 feet of it must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. A creature takes [[/r 2d8]] acid damage on a failed save, or half as much as on a successful one. If this damage reduces a creature to 0 hit points, it must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it dies immediately without making death saving throws. A disintegrated creature and everything unenhanced it is wearing or carrying are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. A creature destroyed in this way can not be revitalized.</p>",
