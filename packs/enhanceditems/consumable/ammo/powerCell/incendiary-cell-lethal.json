This bonus is in addition to any bonuses granted by the weapon. Once the incendiary cell is depleted, it no longer gives a bonus. Additionally, the loaded weapon deals fire damage instead of its normal damage type, and when you hit with a shot it sets the ground beneath it in a 5-foot square ablaze for 1 minute. When a creature enters the fire or starts its turn there it must make a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes [[/r 1d10]] fire damage or half as much on a successful one. A construct makes this save with disadvantage.</p>\n<p>Â </p>\n<h2>Incendiary cell</h2>\n<p>An incendiary cell is a specialized power cell for use with blaster weapons that deal acid, energy, fire, ion, or sonic damage.
