After meditating with the holocron for at least 4 hours, a forcecaster with a Max Power Level of 1st or higher can make a DC 14 forcecasting ability check with proficiency based on the alignment of the power stored within. On a success, they learn the contained force power, which does not count against their force powers known and can not be unlearned except through use of a <em>remove curse</em> power. On a failure, the power is not learned and the forcecaster can't try again for 24 hours.</p>\n<p><em>Holocrons are information-storage devices used by Force-wielders that contain ancient lessons or valuable information in holographic form.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Holocron</h2>\n<p>Holocrons are information-storage devices used by force wielders that contain ancient lessons or valuable information in holographic form.
