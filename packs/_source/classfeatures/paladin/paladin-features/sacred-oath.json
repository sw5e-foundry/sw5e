      "value": "<p>When you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds you as a paladin forever. Up to this time you have been in a preparatory stage, committed to the path but not yet sworn to it. Now you choose an oath, such as the Oath of Devotion.</p>\n<p>Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. Those features include oath powers and the Channel Divinity feature.</p>\n<h5>Oath Powers</h5>\n<p>Each oath has a list of associated powers. You gain access to these powers at the levels specified in the oath description. Once you gain access to an oath power, you always have it prepared. Oath powers don't count against the number of powers you can prepare each day.</p>\n<p>If you gain an oath power that doesn't appear on the paladin power list, the power is nonetheless a paladin power for you.</p>\n<h5>Channel Divinity</h5>\n<p>See @UUID[Compendium.sw5e.classfeatures.Item.8M7uOPhbTxoxxJSo]{Channel Divinity}.</p>",
