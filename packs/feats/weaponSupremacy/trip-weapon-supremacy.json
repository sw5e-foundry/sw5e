If you have a free hand, you catch the weapon. Otherwise, it lands at your feet. </li>\n<li>You have advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks and attack rolls made to trip a creature.</li>\n<li>When you take the Attack action, you can choose to forgo one or more attacks to <strong>interrupt</strong>. For each attack you forgo, one creature within your reach gains no benefit to armor class from its shield until the end of its next turn. If you could already interrupt, instead you can do so as your bonus action.</li></ul>",
