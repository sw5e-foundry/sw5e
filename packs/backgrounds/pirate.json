Those that prey on the Empire are sometimes even held in high regard as bold warriors. However, you still have contacts within the criminal underworld and you're far closer than most people to the world of murder, theft, and violence that pervades the underbelly of civilization, and you have survived up to this point by flouting the rules and regulations of finer society.</p>\n\t<p></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"background\">\n\t<p><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> Choose two from Athletics, Deception, Intimidation, and Piloting</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"background\">\n\t<p><strong>Tool Proficiencies:</strong> One type of gaming set, your choice of demolitions kit, security kit, or slicer's kit</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"background\">\n\t<p><strong>Equipment:</strong> One set of traveler's clothes, a gaming set you are proficient with, poorly wrought maps of Outer Rim worlds in your territory, a small piece of jewelry worth 100 cr from some exotic planet, and a pouch containing 50 cr</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"background\"><h2>Feature: Galactic Scourge</h2></div>\n<div class=\"background\"><p>You've been from one end of the galaxy to the other. You know the most lucrative trade routes. You have expert knowledge of the various hyperlanes. In addition to this, you know a large number of the models and designs of common space ships that are found in the galaxy. Further, the bonds you formed with your crew are strong, and you can call on their aid even if you've been away from their side for some time. You can expect your former comrades to offer you passage aboard ship, reasonable aid, or shelter when you are in need. Keep in mind that this bond goes both ways, and they may come to you expecting the same.\n</p></div><h2>Background Feat</h2>\n<p>\n\tAs a further embodiment of the experience and training of your background, you can choose from the\n\tfollowing feats:\n</p>\n<div class=\"smalltable\">\n\t<p>\n\t\t</p><table><thead><tr><th>[[/r d8 # Feat]]</th><th>Feat</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class=\"rows\"><th>1</th><th>@Compendium[sw5e.feats.qSXmQGXxdYTfY7JP]{Brawny}</th></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><th>2</th><th>@Compendium[sw5e.feats.pXakrWdEv2BKYYW8]{Silver-tongued}</th></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><th>3</th><th>@Compendium[sw5e.feats.fY1YANOeKzcwN5Kh]{Threatening}</th></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><th>4</th><th>@Compendium[sw5e.feats.qvZ81yL3lMLBro0T]{Ace pilot}</th></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><th>5</th><th>@Compendium[sw5e.feats.EzmwfSSWcXkHLixd]{Competitor}</th></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><th>6</th><th>@Compendium[sw5e.feats.TonpRFhus7GQEe9u]{Specialist}</th></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><th>7</th><th>@Compendium[sw5e.feats.wanxyGoCxISxOFUg]{Feigned confidence}</th></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><th>8</th><th>@Compendium[sw5e.feats.Beg3ouX2K8W2x1lr]{Force of personality}</th></tr></tbody></table>\n\t<p></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"background\"><h2>Suggested Characteristics</h2></div>\n<div class=\"medtable\">\n\t<p>\n\t\t</p><table><thead><tr><th>[[/r d8 # Personality Trait]]</th><th>Personality Trait</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class=\"rows\"><th>1</th><th>I respect my captain and trust my crew.
