At the start of each of that creature's turns, it must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes damage of the triggering type equal to your Intelligence modifier and has disadvantage on attack rolls until the start of its next turn. On a success, this feature ends, and the creature becomes immune to it for one day.</p>\n<p>Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p>",
