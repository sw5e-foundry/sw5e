You learned these principles, and much more, as a member of your tribe.</p>\n<p>Your people have always tried to hold to the old ways. Tradition and taboo have kept your tribe strong while the kingdoms of others have collapsed into chaos and ruin. But for the last few generations, some bands among the tribes were tempted to settle, make peace, trade, and even to build towns. Perhaps this is why your tribe chose to raise up the totems among the people as living embodiments of his power. Perhaps they needed a reminder of who they were and from whence they came. The Chosen of your tribe led bands back to the old ways, and most of your people abandoned the soft ways of civilization.</p>\n\t<p></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"background\">\n\t<p><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> Choose two from Animal Handling, Athletics, Nature, and Survival</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"background\">\n\t<p><strong>Tool Proficiencies:</strong> One type of musical instrument or artisan's implements</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"background\">\n\t<p><strong>Languages:</strong> One of your choice</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"background\">\n\t<p><strong>Equipment:</strong> A hunting trap, a totemic token or set of tattoos marking your loyalty to your tribe, a set of traveler's clothes, and a pouch containing 100 cr</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"background\"><h2>Feature: Barbarian Heritage</h2></div>\n<div class=\"background\"><p>You have an excellent knowledge of not only your tribe's territory, but also the terrain and natural resources of the rest of the worlds.
