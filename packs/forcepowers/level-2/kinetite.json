      "value": "<p><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Sustained Lightning</em></p>\n<p>A 5-foot-diameter sphere of compressed lightning appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within range and lasts for the duration. Any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of the sphere must make a Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes [[/r 2d6]] lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>\n<p>As a bonus action, you can move the sphere up to 30 feet. If you ram the sphere into a creature, that creature must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking [[/r 2d6]] kinetic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one, and the sphere stops moving this turn.</p>\n<p>When you move the sphere, you can direct it over barriers up to 5 feet tall and jump it across pits up to 10 feet wide. The sphere ignites flammable objects not being worn or carried, and it sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Force Potency.</em></strong> When you cast this power with a force slot of 3rd level or higher, both the lightning and kinetic damage increase by [[/r 1d6]] for each slot level above 2nd.</p>",
