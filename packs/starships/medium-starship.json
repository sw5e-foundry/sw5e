The technician's efforts to reinforce the shields are failing. The mechanic is pumping the reactor for every scrap of energy it can generate. The operator is frantically making the final few calculations for the jump to hyperspace. Finally, just as the ship's shields dissipate, the pilot makes the gut call, jettisoning the illicit cargo. As it distracts and hampers the followers, the freighter shifts power to the thrusters and quickly flies away.</p>\n<p>As the pirates activate their tractor beam to attempt to capture the weaponless frigate and its exotic wares, the gunboat escort intercedes. It flies in the line of the tractor, breaking the lock on the frigate, and unleashes a volley of cannon fire. The pirates, incapable of withstanding the salvo, drop the tractor beam and retreat.</p>\n<p>As the gunboat pursues to be sure the pirates don't come back for a second bite at the apple, the crew finally locks on target and unleashes a long-range night-stinger missile, putting a permanent end to the pirates' illicit and unwelcome activities.</p>\n<p>The captain invites his guests into his well-stocked cantina. He eyes the opposition as they take in his ship, assessing their reactions and noting their expressions. Fully aware of the effect the opulent room has on the unprepared, he easily stifles his grin and gestures for the starry-eyed vis-itors to sit across from him. He indicates for the server to bring drinks as he casually leans back and puts his feet on the table, confident this deal will go his way. He presses a button on the tiny remote in his hand, causing hidden panels to slide away and reveal his mostly-legal wares. \"So,\" he says, \"just how many of these do you need, and where will I deliver them?\"</p>\n<p>Medium ships are the bread and butter of the closeknit group. They are large enough to accommodate all of the immediate needs of a crew, while at the same time being small enough to feel cozy.</p>",
