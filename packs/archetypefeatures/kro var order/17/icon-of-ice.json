The radius moves with you.</li>\n<li>You can use your action to create a 15-foot cone of freezing ice extending from your outstretched hand in a direction you choose. Each creature in the cone must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes [[/r 4d6]] cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that fails its save against this effect gains 1 slowed level until the start of your next turn.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At the start of each of your turns, you can use your bonus action to extend the benefits of this feature until the start of your next turn, to a maximum duration of 1 minute. This effect ends immediately if you are incapacitated or die.</p>",
