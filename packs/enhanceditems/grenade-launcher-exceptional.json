      "value": "<h4>Weapon (Grenade Launcher)</h4>\n <p>Rather than traditional power cells, the grenade launcher fires grenades. When firing a grenade at long range, or if you don't meet the grenade launcher's strength requirement, creatures within the radius of the grenade's explosion have advantage on the saving throw. If you lack proficiency in the grenade launcher, you must roll the damage dice twice and take the lesser total. You have a +3 bonus to the save DC and deal one additional damage die with grenades fired by this enhanced grenade launcher. </p>\n<p>Â </p>\n<h2>Grenade launcher</h2>\n<h3>Reload 1</h3>\n<p>A number of shots equal to the reload number can be made with a weapon with this property. A character must then reload it using an action or a bonus action (their choice). You must have one free hand to reload.</p>\n<h3>Special (range 90/360)</h3>\n<p>A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has this property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.</p>\n<h3>Strength 11</h3>\n<p>A weapon with this property has a heavy kickback. While wielding it, you have disadvantage on attack rolls unless you meet the Strength requirement. If the weapon has the burst, penetrating, or rapid property, you must meet the Strength requirement to use this feature. If the weapon lacks the two-handed property, you can wield the weapon in two hands to temporarily reduce the strength number by one step (from 19 to 17, 17 to 15, 15 to 13, or 13 to 11). If this would reduce the strength number below 11, you ignore it entirely.</p>\n<h3>Two-handed</h3>\n<p>A weapon with this property requires two hands to use.</p>",
