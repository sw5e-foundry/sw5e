Over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest, a character can attempt to learn the blueprint. If they do so, they must make a DC 10 Intelligence check with the appropriate tools. On a success, the blueprint for the item is learned. On a failure, the blueprint is not learned, and the character must wait 24 hours before they can try again.</p>\n<p><em>Blueprints contain the secrets of how to craft items of a more complex nature.</em></p>",
