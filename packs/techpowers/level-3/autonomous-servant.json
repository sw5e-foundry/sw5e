(If you control multiple creatures with this power, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one.) You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a simple, general command, such as to fetch a code cylinder, stand watch, or stack some small objects. If you issue no commands, the servant does nothing other than defend itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the servant continues to follow that order until its task is complete.</p>\n<p>When the creature drops to 0 hit points, it reverts to its original form, and any remaining damage carries over to that form.</p>\n<p>The creature is considered a valid target for the <em>tracker droid interface</em> power.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Overcharge Tech.</em></strong> When you cast this power using a tech slot of 4th level or higher, you can animate two additional objects for each slot level above 3rd.</p>",
