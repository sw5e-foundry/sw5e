Additionally, the weapon ignores resistance to energy damage.</p>\n<p>When you attack a creature that has at least one head with this weapon and roll a 20 on the attack roll, you cut off one of the creature's heads. The creature dies if it can't survive without the lost head. A creature is immune to this effect if it is immune to energy damage, doesn't have or need a head, has legendary actions, or the GM decides that the creature is too big for its head to be cut off with this weapon. Such a creature instead takes an extra [[/r 6d6]] energy damage from the hit.</p>\n<p><em>The Darksaber was an ancient and unique black-bladed lightsaber created by Tarre Vizsla, the first Mandalorian ever inducted into the Jedi Order. It features a distinctly Mandalorian hilt and an ominous black blade.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Martial lightsaber</h2>\n<h3>Hidden</h3>\n<p>You have advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks made to conceal a weapon with this property.</p>\n<h3>Luminous</h3>\n<p>A weapon with this property sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius while activated. Additionally, Dexterity (Stealth) checks made while the weapon is activated have disadvantage.</p>\n<h3>Versatile ([[/r 1d10]])</h3>\n<p>A weapon with this property can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.\t</p>",
