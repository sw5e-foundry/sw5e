      "value": "<p>By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divine magic through meditation and prayer to cast powers as a cleric does.</p>\n<h5>Preparing and Casting Powers</h5>\n<p>The Paladin table shows how many power slots you have to cast your powers. To cast one of your paladin powers of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the power's level or higher. You regain all expended power slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p>You prepare the list of paladin powers that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin power list. When you do so, choose a number of paladin powers equal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one power). The powers must be of a level for which you have power slots.</p>\n<p>For example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level power slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared powers can include four powers of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level power cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2ndlevel slot. Casting the power doesn't remove it from your list of prepared powers.</p>\n<p>You can change your list of prepared powers when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin powers requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per power level for each power on your list.</p>\n<h5>Powercasting Ability</h5>\n<p>Charisma is your powercasting ability for your paladin powers, since their power derives from the strength of your convictions. You use your Charisma whenever a power refers to your powercasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a paladin power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p><strong>Power save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>\n<p><strong>Power attack modifier </strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>\n<h5>Powercasting Focus</h5>\n<p>You can use a holy symbol as a powercasting focus for your paladin powers.</p>",
