While wearing your spiked armor, you gain the effects of the chosen option. Over the course of a long rest, you can select a different option, provided you have the armor and armormech's implements with you.</p>\n<h3>Defensive Field</h3>\n<p>On your turn, you can use a bonus action to gain temporary hit points equal to [[/r 1d12]] + your berserker level. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p>\n<h3>Deflective Layer</h3>\n<p>Your armor class increases by 1.</p>\n<h3>Grappling Line</h3>\n<p>You can use a bonus action to launch a grappling line at one creature of your choice that you can see within 15 feet. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or be pulled up to 10 feet in a straight line towards you. If it ends this movement within 5 feet of you, it takes kinetic damage from your armor spikes equal to your Strength modifier.</p>\n<h3>Integrated Sonar</h3>\n<p>You can use an action to give yourself the benefits of the <em>true sight</em> force power for 1 hour. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p>\n<h3>Neural Interface</h3>\n<p>You are immune to all effects that would cause you to be charmed or frightened.</p>",
