      "value": "<p><em><strong>Path of the Corsair:</strong> 3rd, 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level</em></p>\n<p>You learn to create a number of small but potent grenades. Over the course of a short or long rest, you can create two grenades. You must have a demolitions kit in order to create these grenades. Your grenades can only be used by you, and they lose their potency at the end of your next short or long rest.</p>\n<p>Your grenades can be set to detonate on impact or with a timer that causes them to explode on initiative count 20 (losing all initiative ties). As an action, you can prime and throw one of these grenade at a point you can see within 30 feet + your Strength modifier x 5. Each creature within 5 feet must make a Dexterity, Constitution, or Wisdom saving throw (your choice when you generate the grenade) against your universal force save DC. A creature takes damage using your Kinetic Combat die + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice) on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. The damage is force for Dexterity, necrotic for Constitution, or psychic for Wisdom.</p>\n<p>You can make additional grenades at higher level: three at 5th level, four at 9th level, five at 13th level, and six at 17th level.</p>",
