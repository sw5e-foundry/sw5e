In your formative years, you found your way to one of the galaxy's great institutes of learning, where you were apprenticed and taught that knowledge is a more valuable treasure than gold or gems. Now you are ready to leave your home- not to abandon it, but to quest for new lore to add to its storehouse of knowledge.</p>\n<p>The most well-known of the galaxy's fonts of knowledge is the Library of the Republic. The great library is always in need of workers and attendants, some of whom rise through the ranks to assume roles of greater responsibility and prominence. You might be one of Coruscant's own, dedicated to the curatorship of what is likely the most complete body of lore and history in all the world.</p>\n\t<p></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"background\">\n\t<p><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> Choose two from Insight, Lore, Investigation, and Nature</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"background\">\n\t<p><strong>Languages:</strong> Two of your choice</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"background\">\n\t<p><strong>Equipment:</strong> A set of common clothes, a datapad and 10 data cards, a book on the subject of your current study, and a pouch containing 100 cr</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"background\"><h2>Feature: Library Access</h2></div>\n<div class=\"background\"><p>Though others must often endure extensive interviews and significant fees to gain access to even the most common archives in your library, you have free and easy access to the majority of the library, though it might also have repositories of lore that are too valuable, powerful, or secret to permit anyone immediate access.\nYou have a working knowledge of your cloister's personnel and bureaucracy, and you know how to navigate those connections with some ease.\nAdditionally, you are likely to gain preferential treatment at other libraries across the galaxy, as professional courtesy shown to a fellow scholar.\n</p></div><h2>Background Feat</h2>\n<p>\n\tAs a further embodiment of the experience and training of your background, you can choose from the\n\tfollowing feats:\n</p>\n<div class=\"smalltable\">\n\t<p>\n\t\t</p><table><thead><tr><th>[[/r d8 # Feat]]</th><th>Feat</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class=\"rows\"><th>1</th><th>@Compendium[sw5e.feats.0ouvGghIhtufl2a9]{Empathic}</th></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><th>1</th><th>@Compendium[sw5e.feats.dzDViHHT3aZ68eTz]{Loremaster}</th></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><th>2</th><th>@Compendium[sw5e.feats.4O9ON0Km4QZ2ogZu]{Investigator}</th></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><th>4</th><th>@Compendium[sw5e.feats.OOTZcS7bWg0Ltaha]{Naturalist}</th></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><th>5</th><th>@Compendium[sw5e.feats.bqcghDqZHiXg1VqF]{Linguist}</th></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><th>6</th><th>@Compendium[sw5e.feats.bP2iKrNSUJyxFyMH]{Keen mind}</th></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><th>7</th><th>@Compendium[sw5e.feats.7diQN6VoqJhyYGtA]{Observant}</th></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><th>8</th><th>@Compendium[sw5e.feats.D6Un07pgFu6I0ybW]{Healer}</th></tr></tbody></table>\n\t<p></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"background\"><h2>Suggested Characteristics</h2></div>\n<div class=\"medtable\">\n\t<p>\n\t\t</p><table><thead><tr><th>[[/r d8 # Personality Trait]]</th><th>Personality Trait</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class=\"rows\"><th>1</th><th>I use polysyllabic words that convey the impression of great erudition.</th></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><th>2</th><th>I've read every book in the world's greatest libraries—or I like to boast that I have.</th></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><th>3</th><th>I'm used to helping out those who aren't as smart as I am, and I patiently explain anything and everything to others.</th></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><th>4</th><th>There's nothing I like more than a good mystery.</th></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><th>5</th><th>I'm willing to listen to every side of an argument before I make my own judgment.</th></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><th>6</th><th>I... speak... slowly... when talking... to idiots,... which... almost... everyone... is... compared... to me.</th></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><th>7</th><th>I am horribly, horribly awkward in social situations.</th></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><th>8</th><th>I'm convinced that people are always trying to steal my secrets.</th></tr></tbody></table>\n\t<p></p>\n</div>\n<p> </p><div class=\"medtable\">\n\t<p>\n\t\t</p><table><thead><tr><th>[[/r d6 # Ideal]]</th><th>Ideal</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class=\"rows\"><th>1</th><th>Knowledge: The path to power and self-improvement is through knowledge.
