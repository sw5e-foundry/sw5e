Over the course of a long rest, you can modify yourself with cybernetic augmentations. You must have biotech's implements in order to perform this modification.</p>\n<p>While you have at least one cybernetic augmentation installed, your body counts as a tech focus for your tech powers. Additionally, you have 4 modification slots, and you gain more at higher levels, as shown in the Modification Slots column of the engineer table. For each modification installed in excess of your proficiency bonus, your tech point maximum is reduced by 1. Over the course of a long rest, you can install, replace, or remove a number of modifications up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one).</p>\n<p>Some modification effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your tech save DC.</p>",
