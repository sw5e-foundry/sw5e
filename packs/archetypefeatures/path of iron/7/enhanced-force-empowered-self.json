      "value": "<p><em><strong>Path of Iron:</strong> 7th level</em></p>\n<p>Through intense physical training, you've improved your body's ability to access and channel the force flowing within you. </p>\n<p>When you would use a Force-Empowered Self option, you can choose to bolster the option, gaining an additional effect as listed below. You can only bolster a Force-Empowered Self option once per turn. </p>\n<p>You can use these features a combined three times. You gain an additional use at 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain any expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<p>While you have no remaining uses of this feature, you can instead expend 1 force point to use it.</p>\n<h3>Aegis</h3>\n<p>When you bolster Deflection, when an attack would hit you before the start of your next turn, you subtract the same value rolled for Deflection from the damage taken.</p>\n<h3>Cleave</h3>\n<p>When you bolster Double Strike, you choose another creature within 5 feet of your target. They take damage of the same type equal to the result of the die rolled for Double Strike.</p>\n<h3>Momentum</h3>\n<p>When you bolster Slow Time, until the end of your turn you ignore difficult terrain, and can move along vertical surfaces and across liquids without falling during the move.</p>",
