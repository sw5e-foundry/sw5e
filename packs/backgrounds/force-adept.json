Your powers may have lain dormant for a long time, perhaps you felt something inside of you but never knew what it was. Perhaps your abilities were awoken by a strong encounter with another force-sensitive with the powers of the Force, or an object associated with the Force, such as a lightsaber.</p>\n\t<p></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"background\">\n\t<p><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> Choose two from Deception, Insight, Perception, and Persuasion</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"background\">\n\t<p><strong>Tool Proficiencies:</strong> Two of your choice of artisan's implements, gaming sets, or musical instruments</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"background\">\n\t<p><strong>Equipment:</strong> A set of common clothes, a sturdy knife, and a belt pouch containing 150 cr</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"background\"><h2>Feature: Guided by the Force</h2></div>\n<div class=\"background\"><p>When you attempt to learn a piece of knowledge, you often instinctively know where or from whom you can obtain it.
