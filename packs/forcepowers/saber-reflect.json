If you reduce the damage to 0, you're wielding a lightweapon or vibroweapon, and the damage is energy or ion, you can reflect the attack at a target within range as part of the same reaction. Make a ranged force attack at a target you can see. The attack has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. On a hit, the target takes the triggering attack's normal damage. </p>\n<p>The power's damage reduction increases by [[/r 1d6]] when you reach 5th level ([[/r 2d6]]), 11th level ([[/r 3d6]]), and 17th level ([[/r 4d6]]).</p>",
