You gain proficiency with medium armor and martial vibroweapons. If you are already proficient in medium armor, you instead gain proficiency in heavy armor. Additionally, you can deal Sneak Attack damage with any weapon, as long as it does not have the heavy or special properties.</p>\n<p>Lastly, you don't need advantage on your attack roll to use your Sneak Attack if no creature other than your target is within 5 feet of you, as long as the target of the attack is below its hit point maximum. All the other rules for the Sneak Attack class feature still apply to you.</p>",
