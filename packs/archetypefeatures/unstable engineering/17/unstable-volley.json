      "value": "<p><em><strong>Unstable Engineering:</strong> 3rd, 9th, and 17th level</em></p>\n<p>While wielding your tinkercannon, as a bonus action you can expend one use of your Potent Aptitude to launch a volley of unstable energy at a surface located within 30 feet of you that you can see. This energy adheres to the surface for 1 minute, after which it erupts. As a part of this bonus action, or as a bonus action on a following turn, you can cause the energy to erupt early. Each creature within 5 feet of it must make a Dexterity saving throw against your tech save DC. A creature takes [[/r 1d6]] lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successfu one. </p>\n<p>The range at which you can launch your volley increases to 60 feet at 9th level, and 120 feet at 17th level.</p>\n<p>This damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to [[/r 2d6]] at 5th level, [[/r 3d6]] at 11th level, and [[/r 4d6]] at 17th level.</p>",
