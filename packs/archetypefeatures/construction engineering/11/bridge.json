      "value": "<p>You deploy a bridge up to 30 feet long, 10 feet wide, and 3 feet thick. The bridge starts from the point at which you deploy it, and extends in a direction of your choice. When you dismantle your bridge, it retracts to the point at which you initially deployed it. Both ends of the bridge must be supported in some fashion; one end cannot be suspended in the air or on unstable terrain. The bridge can hold up to 1,000 lbs., any weight above which causes the bridge to instantly drop to 0 hit points, destroying it. If a creature is on the bridge when it is destroyed or dismantled, it must make a Dexterity saving throw against your tech save DC. On a successful saving throw, it reaches the closest part of the bridge that has stable support, or it maintains a grip on your bridge as it retracts, as appropriate. On a failed save, it falls. </p>\n<p>When you reach 11th level, the bridge can now extend up to 45 feet long, 15 feet wide, and it can support up to 2,000 lbs. When you reach 17th level, the bridge can now extend up to 60 feet long, 20 feet wide, and it can support up to 4,000 lbs.</p>",
