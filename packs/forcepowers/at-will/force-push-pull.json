      "value": "<p>You gain the minor ability to move or manipulate creatures and objects with the Force. You can exert fine control on objects with your telekinetic grip, such as manipulating a simple tool, opening a door or a container, stowing or retrieving an item from an open container, or pouring the contents from a vial. Alternatively, you can push or pull a creature or object you can see. </p>\n<p>You use the Force to move a Medium or smaller creature or object not being worn or carried within range. The target must make a Strength saving throw. An object automatically fails this saving throw. On a failed save, the creature or object moves a number of feet in a direction of your choice based on its size. A Tiny creature or object can be moved up to 20 feet, a Small creature or object can be moved up to 10 feet, and a Medium creature or object can be moved up to 5 feet. If at the end of this movement the creature or object strikes another creature or object, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. An object automatically fails this saving throw. On a failed save, they both take [[/r 1d4]] kinetic damage.</p>\n<p>This power improves when you reach higher levels. At 5th level, you can move a Tiny creature or object up to 30 feet, a Small creature or object up to 20 feet, a Medium creature or object up to 10 feet, and the power's damage increases to [[/r 2d4]] kinetic damage. At 11th level, you can move a Small creature or object up to 30 feet, a Medium creature up to 20 feet, and the power's damage increases to [[/r 3d4]] kinetic damage. At 17th level, you can move a Medium creature to up 30 feet, and the power's damage increases to [[/r 4d4]] kinetic damage.</p>",
