The wall can be damaged and breached; each 10-foot section has AC 5, 30 hit points, vulnerability to <em>fire damage</em>, and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and <em>psychic damage</em>. If a section is destroyed, it leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in the space the wall occupied.

The frigid air dissipates when the rest of the wall vanishes.</p>\n</section>\n<p>The {creature} magically forms an opaque wall of ice on a solid surface it can see within 60 feet of it.
