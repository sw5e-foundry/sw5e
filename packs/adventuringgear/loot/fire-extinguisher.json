Additionally, each creature within range must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is blinded until the start of their next turn. On a successful save, a creature becomes immune to this effect. An extinguisher can be used 5 times before it must be replenished at its original cost.</p>",
