This bonus is in addition to any bonuses granted by the weapon. Additionally, hit or miss, the missile then explodes, setting the ground beneath it in a 15 foot radius ablaze for 1 minute. When a creature enters the fire or starts its turn there it must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes [[/r 2d8]] fire damage or half as much on a successful one.
