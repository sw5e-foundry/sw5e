They must end this movement within 30 feet of you.</li>\n<li><strong>Disengage:</strong> The creature can move up to 5 feet. If this movement would provoke an opportunity attack, the opportunity attack is made with disadvantage.</li>\n<li><strong>Hide:</strong> The creature has advantage on the first attack roll they make before the end of their next turn against a creature you successfully hide from.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can use this feature twice. You gain an additional use at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p>",
