Once per turn, you can deal an extra [[/r 1d6]] damage to one creature you hit with a weapon attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. This damage is the same as the weapon's damage, and the attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon. </p>\n<p>You don't need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn't incapacitated, and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll.</p>\n<p>The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the operative table.</p>",
