      "value": "<p><em><strong>Totem Specialist:</strong> 3rd level</em></p>\n<p>You've learned to create powerful talismans infused with the Force. Your totems can take the form of sigils painted directly onto your equipment, or adornments attached to it, as you see fit. Regardless of the form they take, only you can benefit from them. You learn two totems of your choice, which are detailed under \"Totems\" below. When you complete a long rest, you can replace one totem you know with a different one.</p>\n<p>When you finish a long rest, you can touch a number of weapons, armor, or shields equal to the number of totems you know, affixing a different totem to each object. Your totem remains affixed until you finish a long rest, and an object can only bear one totem at a time. You must be wielding or wearing the object to benefit from a totem affixed to it.</p>\n<p>Each totem can be invoked to grant an effect. Once you've invoked a totem in this way, you can't do so again until you complete a short or long rest.</p>",
