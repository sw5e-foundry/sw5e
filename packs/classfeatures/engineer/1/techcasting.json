      "value": "<p><em><strong>Engineer:</strong> 1st level</em></p>\n<p>During your training you have derived powers from schematics with the aid of your wristpad. See chapter 10 for the general rules of techcasting and chapter 12 for the tech powers list.</p>\n<h3>Tech Powers Known</h3>\n<p>You learn 6 tech powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Tech Powers Known column of the engineer table. You may not learn a tech power of a level higher than your Max Power Level.</p>\n<h3>Tech Points</h3>\n<p>You have a number of tech points equal to your engineer level x 2, as shown in the Tech Points column of the engineer table, + your Intelligence modifier. You use these tech points to cast tech powers. You regain all expended tech points when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<h3>Max Power Level</h3>\n<p>Many tech powers can be overcharged, consuming more tech points to create a greater effect. You can overcharge these powers to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the engineer table.</p>\n<p>You may only cast tech powers at 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.</p>\n<h3>Techcasting Ability</h3>\n<p>Intelligence is your techcasting ability for your tech powers. You use your Intelligence whenever a power refers to your techcasting ability. Additionally, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a tech power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p><em></em>_</p>\n<p><strong>Tech save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\n<p><em></em>_</p>\n<p><strong>Tech attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\n<p><em></em>_</p>\n<h3>Techcasting Focus</h3>\n<p>You use a wristpad (found in chapter 5) or the tools in which you are granted proficiency by this class as a tech focus for your tech powers.</p>",
