Now, you look forward to fighting foes and reaping even greater rewards as an adventurer. Your experience makes you familiar with the ins and outs of mercenary life, and you likely have harrowing stories of events on the battlefield. You might have served with a large outfit or a smaller band of sell-swords, maybe even more than one. </p>\n<p>Now you're looking for something else, perhaps greater reward for the risks you take, or the freedom to choose your own activities. For whatever reason, you're leaving behind the life of a soldier for hire, but your skills are undeniably suited for battle, so now you fight on in a different way.</p>\n\t<p></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"background\">\n\t<p><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> Choose two from Athletics, Investigation, Persuasion, and Piloting</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"background\">\n\t<p><strong>Tool Proficiencies:</strong> One type of gaming set</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"background\">\n\t<p><strong>Languages:</strong> One of your choice</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"background\">\n\t<p><strong>Equipment:</strong> A uniform of your company (traveler's clothes in quality), an insignia of your rank, a gaming set (one of your choice), and a pouch containing the remainder of your last wages (100 cr)</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"background\"><h2>Feature: Mercenary Life</h2></div>\n<div class=\"background\"><p>You know the mercenary life as only someone who has experienced it can.
