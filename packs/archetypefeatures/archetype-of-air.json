      "value": "<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Ride the Wind</em></p>\n<p>As an action, you conjure a whirlwind around you, granting the following benefits until the start of your next turn:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ranged attacks made against you have disadvantage.</li>\n<li>You gain a flying speed of 60 feet. If you are still flying when the technique ends, you fall, unless you can somehow prevent it.</li>\n<li>You can use your action to create a 15-foot cube of swirling wind centered on a point you can see within 60 feet of you. Each creature in that area must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes [[/r 2d10]] kinetic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If a Large or smaller creature fails the save, that creature is also pushed up to 10 feet away from the center of the cube.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At the start of each of your turns, you can use your bonus action to extend the benefits of this feature until the start of your next turn, to a maximum duration of 1 minute. This effect ends immediately if you are incapacitated or die.</p>",
