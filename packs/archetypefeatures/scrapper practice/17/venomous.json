Over the course of a short or long rest, you can create two doses of poison. You must have a poisoner's kit in order to create these doses. Your doses can only be used by you, and they lose their potency at the end of your next short or long rest.</p>\n<p>As an action, you can use one of your doses to coat one vibroweapon, one slug cartridge, or one wrist launcher dart. A creature hit by the coated weapon must make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier), taking [[/r 1d4]] + your Intelligence modifier poison damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one. Once applied, the poison retains potency for 1 minute before drying.</p>\n<p>The quantity and damage of your doses increases at higher levels, to three and [[/r 2d4]] at 5th level, four and [[/r 3d4]] at 9th level, five and [[/r 4d4]] at 13th level, and six and [[/r 5d4]] at 17th level.</p>",
