It gains one more additional trait when you reach 11th level in this class. For each trait in excess of your proficiency bonus, your force point maximum is reduced by 2.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Lastly, while bonded and within 10 feet of you, when your companion is hit by an attack, you can use your reaction and expend a use of your Force Shield feature to shroud it in Force energy. If you do so, until the start of your next turn, both you and your companion gain the benefits of your Force Shield. This includes the triggering attack.</p>\n<p>At 11th level, your companion must be within 30 feet of you to benefit from this feature. At 17th level, your companion must be within 60 feet.</p>",
