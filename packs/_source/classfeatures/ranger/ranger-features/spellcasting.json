      "value": "<p>By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical essence of nature to cast powers, much as a druid does.</p>\n<h5>Power Slots</h5>\n<p>The Ranger table shows how many power slots you have to cast your powers of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these powers, you must expend a slot of the power's level or higher. You regain all expended power slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p>For example, if you know the 1st-level power <em>animal friendship </em>and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level power slot available, you can cast <em>animal friendship </em>using either slot.</p>\n<h5>Powers Known of 1st Level and Higher</h5>\n<p>You know two 1st-level powers of your choice from the ranger power list.</p>\n<p>The Powers Known column of the Ranger table shows when you learn more ranger powers of your choice. Each of these powers must be of a level for which you have power slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new power of 1st or 2nd level.</p>\n<p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger powers you know and replace it with another power from the ranger power list, which also must be of a level for which you have power slots.</p>\n<h5>Powercasting Ability</h5>\n<p>Wisdom is your powercasting ability for your ranger powers, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a power refers to your powercasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p><strong>Power save DC </strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\n<p><strong>Power attack modifier </strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>",
