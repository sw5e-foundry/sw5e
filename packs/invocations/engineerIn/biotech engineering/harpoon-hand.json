      "value": "<p>This augmentation replaces a hand.</p>\n<p>You modify your hand, granting it the ability to transform into a harpoon. With this hand, you can make a ranged weapon attack with a range of 30/60. On a hit, it deals [[/r 1d6]] kinetic damage. This attack can target a surface, object, or creature.</p>\n<p>A creature struck by this attack is impaled by the harpoon. As an action, a creature can attempt to remove the harpoon. Removing the harpoon requires a Strength check. While the harpoon is stuck in the target, you are connected to the target by a 60 foot cable.</p>\n<p>While the harpoon is deployed, you can use your bonus action to activate the reel, pulling yourself to the location if the target is larger than you. A creature or object your size or smaller is pulled to you. Alternatively, you can opt to release the cable (no action required).</p>\n<p>Once you've used this feature, you can't use your hand again until you recover and reinsert it as an action.</p>\n<p>You can choose this modification multiple times.</p>",
