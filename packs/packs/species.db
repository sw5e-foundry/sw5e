These tails are very strong and are commonly used to carry large objects. When meditating or at rest, a thisspiasian will coil their tail beneath their torso, reducing their height by several feet. They also possess four arms, with the upper set being stronger and larger. Each of their four hands have five fingers, and each finger is tipped with a long, sturdy claw. It is thought unsophisticated or unseemly by upper-class thisspiasians to have the bottom two visible in public, so they are generally hidden from sight via larger garments, with the smaller limbs sometimes even bound to their bodies. Thisspiasians need very little sleep to function normally, resting for only two hours a day, with brief meditative moments scattered throughout the day to refocus.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Thisspiasian culture is one of proud warriors who keep their emotions well-concealed and their rages checked. Many outsiders see only a thisspiasian's outward facade of tranquility, and to most being it seems as if thisspiasians existed in a sea of calm.

Cold-blooded reptiles, trandoshans had two super-sensitive varied color eyes with horizontal black pupils, which could see far into the infrared range. Each of their four limbs ends in three razor sharp claws. These are perfect for combat, but did not grant them manual dexterity, making a trandoshan's finger movements somewhat clumsy and awkward. </p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Trandoshans worship their goddess, the Scorekeeper, whom they would appease through acts which increased their Jagannath points.

Their insectoid minds provide them a natural defense against mind tricks. </p>\n<p>Some members are colicoid queens that are different as they are more than twice the size of even the largest warrior breeds. This makes them extremely dangerous and are the only colicoids that possess a unique poisonous stinger. This combined with their strength and size makes them deadly combatants, especially when within their nests. However, a queen tends to only fight when her young are being threatened.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Though highly intelligent, colicoids are emotionless and cannibalistic in nature. Their ruthless cunning serves them well on the battlefield as it does on the negotiating table. It is known that long ago that they transferred these ruthless characteristics to their commerce activities. As a result, they are known to be brutally efficient in their business practices. They are noted for being vicious and calculating creatures that are driven by greed whilst showing little regard for others. The colicoids have numerous successful commercial ventures and hold strict business protocols. </p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Colicoid names are typically very short and gender neutral, with surnames being based on the queen from which they spawned. </p>\n<p><strong>First Names.</strong> Gal, Het, Kaf, Lyp, Nok, Yin</p>\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> Bek, Dor, Set, Tel, Wim, Zal</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"EC","traits":{"value":"<p><em><strong>@Compendium[sw5e.speciesfeatures.m8GWdbj5WvXkF9Kr]{Ability Score Increase}.</strong></em> Your Intelligence score increases by 2, and your Strength or Constitution score increases by 1.</p>\n<p><em><strong>@Compendium[sw5e.speciesfeatures.cowbWf4ngIzIUrkm]{Age}.</strong></em> Colicoids reach adulthood by 8 and live to be about 65.</p>\n<p><em><strong>@Compendium[sw5e.speciesfeatures.WD3MHdyBow9jQ0Gb]{Alignment}.</strong></em> Colicoid's emotionless nature causes them to tend towards balanced alignments, though there are exceptions.</p>\n<p><em><strong>@Compendium[sw5e.speciesfeatures.4u5ylBfOVzDspEmb]{Size}.</strong></em> Colicoids typically stand 6 to 6 and a half feet tall and generally weigh about 170 lbs.

As a result, they are known for their ill-tempered demeanor, and many are bullying thugs.</p>\n<p>On their homeworld of Malastare, the vast majority of Dugs are little more than laborers toiling for the enrichment of the Gran. With the species excluded from much of the power and money on Malastare, many Dugs turn to swoop racing or bounty hunting as their only means to achieve fame and fortune. In all other areas, the Dugs are exploited.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Dug names are often 3 syllables long, mostly through big sounds rather than harsh tones. There are harsher tones in their names as well though, often in the forms of x's and k's. Female Dugs have softer names, but no one would call them beautiful.

Their eyes, made up of thousands of photoreceptors, can not detect fine shapes, only seeing blurry objects. To aid this, they have a small sensory organ between their eyes.

These genetic differences are attributed to the distinct features of their homeworld, Neimoidia, including its gravity, which is markedly heavier than duro.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Neimoidians spend their formative years as puny grubs in the communal hives of Neimoidia, until the age of seven standard years. They are knowingly neglected by being given limited amounts of food. This way, the weaker individuals are weeded out, while the most acquisitive grubs hoard more food than they can eat by themselves. Neimoidian education ensures the survival of the greediest. Neimoidians place tremendous value on wealth and material possessions, and would go to great lengths to gain money and power. This has resulted in a stereotype of neimoidians being greedy and cowardly. While not all neimoidians are easily intimidated, many prefer to avoid direct combat.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Neimoidian names are usually short and easy to pronounce, to make them more memorable to other species that approach them as consumers.

They possess two biological traits of note. The first is that they all produce potent pheromones, similar to the Falleen species, which enhanced their attractiveness and likeability. The second is a limited telepathic ability, used to project emotions onto others, as well as allowing them to read and even feel the emotions of others; some Zeltrons have been hired by the Exchange for this ability. Because of their telepathic ability, positive emotions such as happiness, love and pleasure are very important to them, while negative ones such as anger, fear, or depression are shunned.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Zeltron culture is highly influenced by sexuality and the pursuit of pleasure in general. Most of their art and literature is devoted to the subject, producing some of the raciest pieces in the galaxy. Zeltrons are known to dress in wildly colorful or revealing attire. It's common to see Zeltrons wearing shockingly bright shades of neon colors in wildly designed bikinis, or nearly skin tight clothing of other sorts with bizarre color designs, patterns, and symbols. </p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Zeltron names often have an air of mystique to them, to evoke sensuality.

Togruta have the ability to sense the proximity and movement of physical objects around them by means of their hollow montrals, which detect space ultrasonically.

Yar Togna is a foul-smelling, high-gravity planet with a toxic, fume-saturated atmosphere. As a result, tognath wear a breathing apparatus to process the oxygen content in a planet's atmosphere. The tognath have a striking look thanks to their insectoid and mammalian characteristics; another factor is their having both an endo- and exoskeleton. They also possess a very primitive nervous system, which provides them with immunity to most pain (a helpful trait in combat). Tognath begin life as larvae born from egg clutches hatched in a suspension jelly, and latch onto one of their parents, feeding directly from their bloodstream. While in that jelly, two or more eggs (not necessarily from the same parent) sometimes graft together, thus creating a bond that continues throughout the life of the eggmates. Six months later, parents visit a nursery tree, where the young detatch from them and spin a cocoon. Within, the offspring undergo a metamorphosis, developing both their skeletons to resist the high gravity and pressures of Yar Togna.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Tognath live in stilted homes with lava channels near the main mountain range of Yar Togna, where they have access to mountain springwater. Most of tognath society believes that mate selection and egg laying should occur late in life, after having dedicated most of one's prime years to a career.

Devaronians have silver-based blood, which appears thick and black when exposed. They possess a unique blood filtration and cleansing system which processes through two livers. Because their bodies are constantly cleansed of toxins and carcinogens, the species is highly resistant to poison. To this end, sulfur is used as a stimulant on Devaron to enhance speed and strength, because inhaling it causes the substance to enter the bloodstream rapidly. Their livers struggle to eliminate sulfur from their system, meaning that long-term use can be dangerous.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Devaronian males are driven by an urge to wander, usually taking the first opportunity to move on from one place to another; they are often found traveling the galaxy as tramp freighter captains and scouts.

They often will hide instead of using violence. As pacifists, they carry no weapons but carry farming tools or ropes.

Most, however, have vividly colored hair and pale skin, often mottled with colorful spots. Unfortunately, a series of mutations arose among later generations of theelin. These mutations have led to genetic incompatibilities within their species, making it impossible to produce offspring. Even attempts to continue their species by cross-breeding with other near-humans could not stop the theelin slide towards extinction, due to the high infant mortality rates such couplings suffer from. Theelin began inevitably dwindling in number—only a few million theelin and part-theelin remain by the time the Republic fell, and pure theelin are presumed extinct by the fall of the Empire.
