If its soul is free and willing, the target returns to life with all its hit points.</p><p>This power neutralizes any poisons and cures normal diseases afflicting the creature when it died. It doesn't, however, remove magical diseases, curses, and the like; if such effects aren't removed prior to casting the power, they afflict the target on its return to life.</p><p>This power closes all mortal wounds and restores any missing body parts.</p><p>Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a âˆ’4 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Every time the target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears.</p><p>Casting this power to restore life to a creature that has been dead for one year or longer taxes you greatly. Until you finish a long rest, you can't cast powers again, and you have disadvantage on all attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.</p>",
