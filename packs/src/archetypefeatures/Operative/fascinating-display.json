      "value": "<p><em><strong>Beguiler Practice:</strong> 3rd level</em></p>\n<p>You can spend 1 minute attemping to distract and enthrall those around you. Choose a number of humanoids within 60 feet of you who watched your display for the duration, up to a number equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be charmed by you. While charmed in this way, the target idolizes you, speaking glowingly of you to anyone who talks to it. Additionally, it hinders anyone who opposes you, although it avoids violence unless it was already inclined to fight on your behalf. This effect ends on a target after 1 hour, if it takes any damage, if you attack it, or if it witnesses you attacking or damaging any of its allies. If a target succeeds on this saving throw, the target has no hint you tried to charm it.</p>\n<p>Once you've used this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.</p>",
