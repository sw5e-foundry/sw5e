You gain the following benefits.</p>\n<h3>Echani Weapons</h3>\n<p>Choose two types of weapons to be your Echani weapons: one vibroweapon and one blaster. Each of these weapons can be any simple or martial weapon that lacks the special property. You gain proficiency with these weapons if you don't already have it. Weapons of the chosen types are monk weapons for you. Many of this tradition's features work only with your Echani weapons. When you reach 6th, 11th, and 17th level in this class, you can choose another type of weapon to be an Echani weapon for you, following the criteria above.</p>\n<h3>Agile Parry</h3>\n<p>If you make an unarmed strike as part of the Attack action on your turn and are holding an Echani weapon, you can use it to defend yourself if it is a melee weapon. You gain a +2 bonus to AC until the start of your next turn, while the weapon is in your hand and you aren't incapacitated.</p>\n<h3>Echani's Shot</h3>\n<p>You can use a bonus action on your turn to make your ranged attacks with an Echani weapon more deadly. When you do so, any target you hit with a ranged attack using an Echani weapon takes an extra 1d4 damage of the weapon's type. You retain this benefit until the end of the current turn.</p>\n<h2>One with the Blade</h2>\n<p>At 6th level, you extend your focus into your Echani weapons, granting you the following benefits.</p>\n<h3>Enhanced Echani Weapons</h3>\n<p>Your attacks with your Echani weapons count as enhanced for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to unenhanced attacks and damage.</p>\n<h3>Deft Strike</h3>\n<p>When you hit a target with an Echani weapon, you can spend 1 focus point to cause the weapon to deal extra damage to the target equal to your Martial Arts die. You can use this feature only once on each of your turns.</p>\n<h2>Sharpen the Blade</h2>\n<p>Starting at 11th level, you gain the ability to augment your weapons further with your focus. As a bonus action, you can expend up to 3 focus points to grant one Echani weapon you touch a bonus to attack and damage rolls when you attack with it. The bonus equals the number of points you spent. This bonus lasts for 1 minute or until you use this feature again. This feature has no effect on an enhanced weapon that already has a bonus to attack and damage rolls.</p>\n<h2>Unerring Accuracy</h2>\n<p>At 17th level, your mastery of weapons grants you extraordinary accuracy. If you miss with an attack roll using a monk weapon on your turn, you can reroll it. You can use this feature only once on each of your turns.</p>"},"source":"PHB","activation":{"cost":null,"type":""},"actionType":"","damage":{"parts":[]},"armorproperties":{"parts":[]},"weaponproperties":{"parts":[]},"classCasterType":""},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false}},"img":"systems/sw5e/packs/Icons/Archetypes/Echani%20Order.webp","effects":[]}

When you finish a long rest, roll two d20s and record the numbers rolled. You can replace any attack roll, saving throw, or ability check made by you or a creature that you can see with one of these foretelling rolls. You must choose to do so before the roll, and you can replace a roll in this way only once per turn. Each foretelling roll can be used only once. When you finish a long rest, you lose any unused foretelling rolls.</p>\n<h2>Powerful Mind</h2>\n<p>At 6th level, you can use your force abilities to read a creature's thoughts. You can then use your access to the creature's mind to command it.</p>\n<p>As an action, choose one creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your universal force save DC. If the creature succeeds on the saving throw, you can't use this feature on it again until you finish a long rest.

The target automatically fails its saving throw against the power.</p>\n<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, a minimum of once).

Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Object Reading.</em></strong> Holding an object as you meditate, you can see visions of the object's previous owner. After meditating for 1 minute, you learn how the owner acquired and lost the object, as well as the most recent significant event involving the object and that owner. If the object was owned by another creature in the recent past (within a number of days equal to your Wisdom score), you can spend 1 additional minute for each owner to learn the same information about that creature.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Area Reading.</em></strong> As you meditate, you see visions of recent events in your immediate vicinity (a room, street, tunnel, clearing, or the like, up to a 50-foot cube), going back a number of days equal to your Wisdom score. For each minute you meditate, you learn about one significant event, beginning with the most recent. Significant events typically involve powerful emotions, such as battles and betrayals, marriages and murders, births and funerals. However, they might also include more mundane events that are nevertheless important in your current situation.</p>\n<h2>Shielded Thoughts</h2>\n<p>At 14th level, your thoughts can't be read by telepathy or other means unless you allow it. You also have resistance to psychic damage, and whenever a creature deals psychic damage to you, that creature takes the same amount of damage that you do.</p>\n<h2>Clarity of Vision</h2>\n<p>Starting at 18th level, the visions in your dreams intensify and paint a more accurate picture in your mind of what is to come.

The decoy appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within 30 feet of you. The decoy is purely visual. If anything passes through it, it is revealed to be an illusion.

As an action, you can manipulate these forces to create one of the following effects of your choice at a space within 10 feet of you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create a harmless, instantaneous sensory effect related to air, earth, fire, or water, such as a shower of sparks, a puff of wind, a spray of light mist, or a gentle rumbling of stone.</li>\n<li>Instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.</li>\n<li>Chill or warm up to 1 pound of nonliving material for up to 1 hour.</li>\n<li>Cause earth, fire, water, or mist that can fit within a 1 foot cube to shape itself into a crude form you designate for 1 minute.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This range increases to 30 feet at 11th level and 60 feet at 17th level.</p>\n<p>Additionally, as a bonus action on your turn, you can spend 1 focus point to conjure a weapon made of one of the four elements&mdash;air, earth, fire, or water&mdash;which lasts for 1 minute. Your weapon takes an appearance of your choice, it can only be used by you, and you can't be disarmed of it while you are conscious. You are proficient in this weapon, which counts as a monk weapon for you and uses your Martial Arts die for its damage rolls. You can only have one of these weapons at a time, and if you summon a new one the old one immediately disappears.</p>\n<h3>Air</h3>\n<p>Your whistling weapon has the thrown property with a range of 20/60 and deals sonic damage on a hit. Additionally, when you hit a creature with the weapon, it is deafened until the end of its next turn.</p>\n<h3>Earth</h3>\n<p>Your earthen weapon takes the form of stone and deals kinetic damage on a hit. Additionally, when you hit a creature with it, you can force the target to make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target is pushed back 5 feet. Lastly, while active, you can use Strength instead of Dexterity when determining your AC, as long as it doesn't already include that modifier.</p>\n<h3>Fire</h3>\n<p>Your flaming weapon sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet, deals fire damage, and when you hit a creature with it, the creature takes additional damage equal to half your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, rounded up, minimum of one).</p>\n<h3>Water</h3>\n<p>Your watery weapon has the reach property, deals cold damage on a hit, and you can use your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice) instead of Dexterity or Strength for its attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls. Additionally, when you would make a melee weapon attack, you can instead use your weapon to wet a 5-foot square within your weapon's reach. The affected area is difficult terrain. Each creature who starts its turn in the square or enters it for the first time must make a Dexterity saving throw, falling prone on a failed save.</p>\n<h2>Elemental Adept</h2>\n<p><em><strong>Kro Var Order:</strong> 6th, 11th, and 17th level</em></p>\n<p>You gain two of the following features.

When you do so, your maximum focus points are reduced by 2 until you complete a long rest.</p>\n<h3>Burning Ember Flourish</h3>\n<p>You can use your action to choose an area of flame that you can see and that fits within a 5-foot cube within 60 feet. You can extinguish the fire in that area, and you create either fireworks or smoke when you do so.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<em><strong>Fireworks.</strong></em> The target explodes with a dazzling display of colors. Each creature within 10 feet of the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become blinded until the end of your next turn.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<em><strong>Smoke.</strong></em> Thick black smoke spreads out from the target in a 20-foot radius, moving around corners. The area of the smoke is heavily obscured. The smoke persists for 1 minute or until a strong wind disperses it.</p>\n<h3>Curtain of Unyielding Wind</h3>\n<p>As an action, you can spend 2 focus points to call up a mighty gale, which swirls around you in a 10-foot radius and moves with you, remaining centered on you. The wind lasts for 10 minutes. The wind deafens both you and other creatures in its area. It extinguishes unprotected flames in its area that are torch-sized or smaller and hedges out vapor, gas, and fog that can be dispersed by strong wind. The area is difficult terrain for creatures other than you, and the attack rolls of ranged weapon attacks have disadvantage if the attacks pass in or out of the wind.</p>\n<h3>Crushing Hand of the Mountain</h3>\n<p>As an action, you can choose a 5-foot-square unoccupied space on the ground that you can see within 30 feet. A Medium hand made from soil and stone, which lasts for 1 minute, rises in that space and reaches for one Large or smaller creature you can see within 5 feet of it. The target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 2d6 kinetic damage and is restrained for the duration. As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can cause the hand to crush the restrained target, which must make a Strength saving throw. It takes 2d6 kinetic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. To break out, the restrained creature can use its action to make a Strength check against your focus save DC. On a success, the target escapes and is no longer restrained by the hand. As an action, you can cause the hand to reach for a different creature or to move to a different unoccupied space within range. The hand releases a restrained target if you do either.</p>\n<h3>Hatchling's Flame</h3>\n<p>As an action, you focus your energy into a torrent of fire that streaks away from you. A line of roaring flame 30 feet long and 5 feet wide emanates from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>\n<h3>Patient Bantha Listens</h3>\n<p>You reach out to the ground beneath you. You can use your bonus action to gain tremorsense with a range of 30 feet and a burrow speed equal to your walking speed for up to 1 minute. Your movement leaves behind a tunnel that remains for as long as this ability is active, after which it collapses.</p>\n<h3>Rush of the Shyrack</h3>\n<p>As an action, you can spend 2 focus points to form a line of strong wind 60 feet long and 10 feet wide that blasts from you in a direction you choose for one minute or until you lose concentration or dismiss the effect (no action required). Each Large or smaller creature that starts its turn in the line must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet away from you in a direction following the line. Any creature in the line must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves when moving closer to you. The gust disperses gas or vapor, and it extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames in the area. It causes protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly and has a 50 percent chance to extinguish them. As a bonus action on each of your turns before the effect ends, you can change the direction in which the line blasts from you.</p>\n<h3>Shape the Raincloud</h3>\n<p>You can use your action to pull water from air and return it to the atmosphere. In an open container, you can create up to 20 gallons of drinkable water. You may also produce a rain that falls within a 30-foot cube and extinguishes open-air flames. You can destroy the same amount of water in an open container, or destroy a 30-foot cube of fog.</p>\n<h3>Swarming Ice Rabbit</h3>\n<p>As an action, you can cause a flurry of ice crystals to erupt from a point you can see within 90 feet. Each creature in a 5-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d6 cold damage and gains 1 slowed level until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't slowed.</p>\n<h2>Elemental Master</h2>\n<p><em><strong>Kro Var Order:</strong> 11th and 17th level</em></p>\n<p>At 11th level, you gain one of the following features. You gain an additional option at 17th level.</p>\n<p>You can use these features a combined number of times equal to half your proficiency bonus, as shown in the monk table. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.</p>\n<p>While you have no remaining uses of this feature, you can instead expend 3 focus points to use it. When you do so, your maximum focus points are reduced by 3 until you complete a long rest.</p>\n<h3>Earth Reaches for Sky</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Crushing Hand of the Mountain or Patient Bantha Listens</em></p>\n<p>As an action, you can choose a point you can see on the ground within 120 feet. A fountain of churned earth and stone erupts in a 20-foot cube centered on that point. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d12 kinetic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Additionally, the ground in that area becomes difficult terrain until cleared. Each 5-foot-square portion of the area requires at least 1 minute to clear by hand.</p>\n<h3>Ride the Wind</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Curtain of Unyielding Wind or Rush of the Shyrack</em></p>\n<p>As an action, you can gain a flying speed equal to your movement speed for 10 minutes. You can hover while this technique is active, but when it ends, you fall if you are still aloft, unless you can stop the fall.</p>\n<h3>River of Hungry Flame</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Burning Ember Flourish or Hatchling's Flame</em></p>\n<p>As an action, you can create a wall of fire on a solid surface within 120 feet. You can make the wall up to 60 feet long, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall is opaque and lasts for 1 minute.</p>\n<p>When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d8 fire damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.</p>\n<p>One side of the wall, chosen by you when you use this feature, deals 5d8 fire damage to each creature that ends its turn within 10 feet of that side of the wall. A creature takes the same damage when it enters the wall for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. The other side of the wall deals no damage.</p>\n<h3>Shape the Flowing River</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Shape the Raincloud or Swarming Ice Rabbit</em></p>\n<p>As an action, you can control any freestanding water within 300 feet of you inside an area you choose that is a cube up to 100 feet on a side. You can choose from any of the following effects when you use this feature. As an action on your turn, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; <em><strong>Flood.</strong></em> You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land. If you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller creatures in the wave's path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller creatures struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of being knocked prone. The water level remains elevated until the feature ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<em><strong>Part Water.</strong></em> You cause water in the area to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends across the feature's area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the feature ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<em><strong>Redirect Flow.</strong></em> You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the feature's area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues co move in the direction you chose until the feature ends or you choose a different effect.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<em><strong>Whirlpool.</strong></em> This effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Strength (Athletics) check against your feature save DC. When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 kinetic damage and is caught in the vortex until the feature ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, and isn't caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but has disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so. The first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object takes 2d8 kinetic damage; this damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex.</p>\n<h2>Elemental Paragon</h2>\n<p><em><strong>Kro Var Order:</strong> 17th level</em></p>\n<p>You gain one of the following features.</p>\n<p>Once you've used the chosen feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.</p>\n<p>While you have no remaining uses of this feature, you can instead expend 4 focus points to use it.

Those who follow this path unlock something deep within them, a well of untamed power from the depths of their fury. When a marauder unleashes their rage, they channel their brute strength into primal might, and uses it to devastate his foes in a hail of fire, blades, and blood. Due to the uncontrolled nature of their powers, marauders have a dangerous predilection for the strength and raw power offered by the dark side, and many fall into it&rsquo;s clutches. Even those who do not are always temped by the voices of fury barely contained within.</p>\n<h2>Forcecasting</h2>\n<p>When you choose this approach at 3rd level, you have derived powers from your primal connection to the Force.

You use these force points to cast force powers. You regain all expended force points when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<h3>Max Power Level</h3>\n<p>Many force powers can be overpowered, consuming more force points to create a greater effect. You can overpower these abilities to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the Marauder Approach Forcecasting table.</p>\n<p>You may only cast force powers at 4th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.</p>\n<h3>Forcecasting Ability</h3>\n<p>Your forcecasting ability varies based on the alignment of the powers you cast. You use your Wisdom for light side powers, Charisma for dark side powers, and Wisdom or Charisma for universal powers (your choice).

While you are raging and you use your action to cast a force power, you can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action.</p>\n<h2>Powerful Presence</h2>\n<p>Starting at 10th level, as a bonus action, you unleash a battle cry infused with force energy.

As an action, you can end your rage early, forcing each creature within 15 feet of you to make a Dexterity saving throw against your universal force save DC.

You have advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn in the combat yet. Additionally, any hit you score against a creature that is surprised is a critical hit.</p>\n<h2>Lethal Strikes</h2>\n<p>Lastly at 3rd level, you learn how to read your foes and strikes their weak points. When you deal Sneak Attack damage to a creature, you may choose to forgo two of your Sneak Attack dice to make the attack a lethal strike.</p>\n<p>Some of your lethal strikes require your target to mak ea saving throw to resist the lethal strike's effects.

You must spend at least 1 minute studying these three components of the person's behavior: listening to speech, examining handwriting, and observing mannerisms. If you can only study some of these aspects (such as only having writing samples, or only audio recordings), you can mimic that aspect of the person, but not other aspects you have not studied.</p>\n<p>Your ruse is indiscernible to the casual observer.

Whenever you learn a new maneuver, you can choose from any of the following as well. The maneuvers are listed in alphabetical order.</p>\n<h3>Force Resonance</h3>\n<p>Immediately after you deal damage to a target with a force attack, you can expend a superiority die and target a second creature that you can see within 30 feet of the first creature. Roll the die, and the second creature takes force damage equal to the roll + your forcecasting modifier.</p>\n<h3>Fortune and Glory</h3>\n<p>When you would make a weapon attack against a target within 30 feet, you can instead manipulate the Force to expend a superiority die and make a Sleight of Hand check using your universal forcecasting ability to plant something on the target, conceal an object on the target, lift the target&rsquo;s purse, or take something from its pocket. Roll the superiority die, and add the result to the check.</p>\n<h3>Fossil Fueled</h3>\n<p>When you would spend force points to cast a force power, you can instead expend a superiority die to cast the power. When you do so, you take necrotic damage equal to the number roll + your forcecasting modifier + twice the power&rsquo;s level. This damage cannot be reduced in anyway.</p>\n<p>For each additional time you use this maneuver without taking a short or long rest, roll an additional superiority die of damage.</p>\n<h3>One with the Force</h3>\n<p>Once per turn, when you make a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a force power, you can expend a superiority die and add the number rolled to the saving throw.</p>\n<h3>Overwhelming Wit</h3>\n<p>Once per round, when a creature succeeds on a force power you cast that requires a Wisdom or Charisma saving throw, you can expend a superiority die to make a universal forcecasting ability check with proficiency, substituting the result of the roll for the save DC for that power.</p>\n<h3>Mind Over Mystery</h3>\n<p>When you are forced to make a saving throw against a force power or effect you can see, you can expend a superiority die to change the saving throw to an Intelligence saving throw.</p>\n<h3>Short Round</h3>\n<p>When you cast a force power of 1st-level or higher that has a casting time of 1 action, you can expend a superiority die to change the casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting.</p>\n<h3>Strikeforce</h3>\n<p>When you make a melee weapon attack against a creature, you can expend one superiority die and add the number rolled to the attack roll. On a hit, the target takes additional force damage equal to the number rolled.</p>\n<h3>You Call This Archaeology?</h3>\n<p>When you or an ally that you can see reduces a hostile creature to 0 hit points, you can use a reaction and expend a superiority die to give that yourself or that ally temporary hit points equal to the number rolled + your forcecasting modifier.</p>\n<h2>Force Carving</h2>\n<p>Beginning at 6th level, you have unlocked more control over the Force, allowing you to choose wisely who it affects. When you cast a force power that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 + the power's level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the power, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save.</p>\n<h2>Psychometric Analysis</h2>\n<p>Starting at 9th level, your strength in the Force and your ability to read the objects around you intensifies. You can use your Critical Analysis to analyze an object of Huge size or smaller that you can see within range. When you do so, you learn whether or not the object is enhanced, cursed, and how old it is.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you can end your Critical Analysis on the object (no action required) to ask it a single question and receive an answer, usually in the form of an auditory or visual hallucination. For example, touching the rusted, broken remains of a lightsaber and asking how it got there may result in a brief vision of a disgruntled Jedi Knight casting it to the ground on that spot. An object \"questioned\" in this way can only provide information relating to its past. The GM has the final say on what objects can be questioned, and to what extent</p>\n<p>You can use this feature four times. You gain an additional use at 13th and 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest</p>\n<h2>Knowledge is Power</h2>\n<p>Once you've reached 17th level, you gain the ability to steal the knowledge of how to cast a power from another forcecaster. When a hostile creature casts a force power that affects a friendly creature within range of your Critical Analysis feature, and you use your reaction target that friendly creature with your Critical Analysis feature, you can force the creature casting the power to make an Wisdom or Charisma saving throw (your choice) against your universal force save DC. On a successful save, the power is cast as normal.</p>\n<p>On a failed save, you negate the power&rsquo;s effects, and you steal the knowledge of that power if it is at least 1 st level and of a level you can cast For the next 8 hours, you know the power and can cast it using your force points. The creature cannot cast that power again until the 8 hours have passed.</p>\n<p>Once you've used this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest</p>\n<h2>Discoveries (Archaeologist)</h2>\n<p>When you select this pursuit, you gain access to new discoveries which reflect your studies into historical civilations. Whenever you leam a new discovery, you can choose from any of the following as well. The discoveries are listed in alphabetical order.</p>\n<h3>Archive Research</h3>\n<p>Your expeditions have turned up a bevy of knowledge on the force.

You must use the same modifier for both rolls.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you gain knowledge of one lightsaber form of your choice.</p>\n<h3>It Belongs in a Museum</h3>\n<p>Your knowledge of antiquities is unparalleled.

Additionally, when you engage in crafting with tinker's tools, the rate at which you craft doubles.</p>\n<h2>Modified Tinkercannon</h2>\n<p>Also at 3rd level, you learn to enhance your tinker's tools with unproven science, modifying them into a backpack with a cannon. Over the course of a long rest, you can expend 500 cr worth of materials to modify your tinker's tools. You must have materials and tinker's tools in order to perform this modification.</p>\n<p>Whenever you cast a tech power of 1st level or higher while wielding your tinker's tools, you risk unexpected complications. Your GM can have you roll a d20. If you roll a 1, roll on the Experimental Engineering Surge table to create a random effect.</p>\n<p>Additionally, your tinker's tools come equipped with 4 overrides, and they gain more at higher levels, as shown in the Modification Slots column of the engineer class table. Each time you trigger an Experimental Engineering Surge, you can use an override to reroll the percentile dice. You must use the new result, you can only do this once per surge, and your maximum tech points is reduced by 1 until you complete a long rest. You regain all expended overrides when you complete a long rest.</p>\n<h2>Unstable Volley</h2>\n<p>Lastly at 3rd level, as a bonus action you can expend one use of your Potent Aptitude to launch a volley of unstable energy at a surface located with-in 30 feet of you that you can see. This energy adheres to the surface for 1 minute, after which it erupts. As a part of this bonus action, or as a bonus action on each of your turns, you can cause the energy to erupt early. Each creature within 5 feet of it must make a Dext-erity saving throw against your tech save DC. A creature takes 1d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.</p>\n<p>This damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 2d6 at 5th level, 3d6 at 11th level, and 4d6 at 17th level.</p>\n<h2>Creative Destruction</h2>\n<p>Beginning at 6th level, you can add your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of +1) to any damage you deal with tech powers and class features. If the tech power or class feature would damage multiple creatures, you can only deal this additional damage to one of them.</p>\n<p>If you choose to deal this additional damage, your GM can have you roll on the Experimental Engineering Surge table.</p>\n<h2>Experimental Overrides</h2>\n<p>At 14th level, you gain a modicum of control over your surges. Whenever you roll on the Experimental Engineering Surge table and use one of your overrides, you can choose either total.</p>\n<h2>Engineering Bombardment</h2>\n<p>Starting at 18th level, the harmful energies of your tech powers and class features intensify. When you roll damage for a tech power or class feature and roll the highest number possible on any of the dice, you can roll it again and use both results. You can only use this ability once per tech power or class feature.</p>\n<div class=\"classtable\">\n<blockquote>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"color: #000000; text-transform: uppercase; font-family: 'Russo One'; background-color: #bdc8cc; font-size: 16px; text-shadow: none;\" colspan=\"6\"><em>Experimental Engineering Surge</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align: left; width: 39px;\">d100</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left; width: 501px;\">Result</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left; width: 37px;\">01-02</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left; width: 499px;\">Roll on this table at the start of each of your turns for 1 minute, ignoring this result on subsequent rolls.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left; width: 37px;\">03-04</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left; width: 499px;\">For the next minute, you can see any invisible creature if you have line of sight to it.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left; width: 37px;\">05-06</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left; width: 499px;\">A DRK-1 tracker droid appears with 5 feet of you, then disappears 1 minute later.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left; width: 37px;\">07-08</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left; width: 499px;\">You cast <em>explosion</em> at 3rd-level centered on yourself without expending tech points.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left; width: 37px;\">09-10</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left; width: 499px;\">You cast <em>homing rockets</em> at 5th-level without expending tech points.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left; width: 37px;\">11-12</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left; width: 499px;\">Roll a d10.

They use these techniques to manipulate their opponent, moving them across the battlefield before incapacitating them.</p>\n<h2>Clinch Strike</h2>\n<p>When you choose this practice at 3rd level, you learn how to discourage, debilitate, and harm your enemies. You gain the following benefits while you aren't wearing heavy armor or a medium or heavy shield:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your unarmed strikes use a d4 for damage.</li>\n<li>You can deal Sneak Attack damage when making an unarmed strike. Additionally, you don't need advantage on your unarmed attack roll to use your Sneak Attack if the target of your Sneak Attack is a creature grappled by you. All the other rules for the Sneak Attack class feature still apply to you.</li>\n<li>You can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to make an unarmed strike against a creature you are grappling.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Skilled Grappler</h2>\n<p>Also at 3rd level, you learn a number of grappling techniques to subdue your opponents. When you hit a creature grappled by you with an unarmed strike and deal Sneak Attack damage, you may choose to forgo two of your Sneak Attack dice to make the attack a grappling technique.</p>\n<p>Some of your grappling techniques require your target to make a saving throw to resist the grappling technique's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>\n<p><strong>Grapple Technique save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier.</p>\n<h3>Constrict</h3>\n<p>You attempt to choke the target into unconscious-ness. The target must make a Constitution saving throw or be restrained until the end of your following turn.</p>\n<p>If you maintain this technique for 1 minute, the target falls unconscious for 1 hour. Droids and constructs can not be knocked unconscious in this way.</p>\n<h3>Disarm</h3>\n<p>You attempt to disarm a weapon or other object the target is holding. The target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it releases the object. If you have a free hand, you can catch the object. Otherwise, it lands at your feet.</p>\n<h3>Hip Toss</h3>\n<p>You attempt to throw your target to the ground. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target is pushed back 5 feet, knocked prone, and stunned until the start of your next turn. This ends the grapple.</p>\n<h2>Human Shield</h2>\n<p>Beginning at 9th level you learn to manipulate the body of a grappled target to make attacks against you more difficult to land. Moving a grappled creature the same size as you or smaller no longer halves your speed, and when a creature grappled by you would grant you half cover, you instead have three-quarters cover. Additionally, when you are hit by an attack while grappling a creature, you can use your reaction to force that attack to instead hit the grappled creature.</p>\n<h2>Kiss the Wall</h2>\n<p>Starting at 13th level, you can use your surroundings to further punish the target of your grapple. When you roll a 1 or 2 on a Sneak Attack damage die for an unarmed attack you make against a creature grappled by you, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2.</p>\n<h2>Neck Snap</h2>\n<p>At 17th level, you learn how to immediately remove your grappled opponent from the fight. As an action, you can force a creature grappled by you to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, if the creature has 100 hit points or fewer, it dies. If the target has more than 100 hit points, it immediately takes 10d10 kinetic damage.

Additionally, when you engage in crafting with gadgeteer's implements, the rate at which you craft doubles.</p>\n<h2>Gadgeteer Harness</h2>\n<p>Also at 3rd level, you learn to create and modify adventuring gear utilizing your gadgeteer experience. Over the course of a long rest, you can expend 500 cr worth of materials to create your modified gadgeteer harness. You must have gadgeteer's implements and materials in order to perform this modification.</p>\n<p>Your gadgeteer harness is enhanced, requires attunement, can only be used by you, and counts as a tech focus for your tech powers while you are attuned to it. Your gadgeteer harness has 4 modification slots to which you can affix gadgets, and it gains more at higher levels, as shown in the Modification Slots column of the engineer class table. For each modification installed, your tech point maximum is reduced by 1. Over the course of a long rest, you can replace or remove a number of modifications up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one).</p>\n<p>Some modification effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your tech save DC.</p>\n<h2>Projected Barrier</h2>\n<p>Lastly at 3rd level, as a bonus action while wearing your gadgeteer harness, you can expend a use of your Potent Aptitude to project a barrier on a friendly creature you can see within 30 feet. A creature can only have one barrier active at a time.</p>\n<h3>Environmental Barrier</h3>\n<p>You project an environmental barrier that lasts until the end of your next short or long rest. The barrier has a number of hit points equal to the amount rolled on your Potent Aptitude die + your engineer level. Whenever a creature with this barrier takes damage (one of acid, cold, fire, force, lightning, necrotic, poison, psychic, or sonic, chosen by you when you activate the effect), the barrier takes the damage instead. If this damage reduces the barrier to 0 hit points, the creature take any remaining damage.</p>\n<h3>Physical Barrier</h3>\n<p>You project a physical barrier that lasts until the end of your next short or long rest. The barrier has a number of hit points equal to the amount rolled on your Potent Aptitude die + half your engineer level (rounded down). Whenever a creature with this barrier takes damage (one of energy, ion, or kinetic, chosen by you when you activate the effect), the barrier takes the damage instead. If this damage reduces the barrier to 0 hit points, the creature take any remaining damage.</p>\n<h2>Versatile Direction</h2>\n<p>Beginning at 6th level, you can take a second bonus action on each of your turns.</p>\n<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<h2>Reinforced Barriers</h2>\n<p>At 14th level, when you cast a tech power while you have a barrier active, you can restore hit points to the barrier, provided it is within 30 feet of you. You restore a number of hit points equal to twice the power's level, or 1 hit point for an at-will power. This can't increase a barrier's hit points above its initial hit points. If you have multiple barriers active, you can divide these hit points between them as you see fit.</p>\n<h2>Adaptive Barrier</h2>\n<p>Starting at 18th level, when a creature who has one of your barriers within 30 feet of you that you can see takes damage, and that damage is of a type that could be affected by that barrier, you can use your reaction to grant them resistance to the triggering damage. If that damage is the same type as the barrier's chosen damage, you instead grant them immunity. Whether resistance or immunity, the barrier immediately drops to 0 hit points.</p>\n<h2>Gadgeteer Contraptions</h2>\n<p>If a modification has prerequisites, you must meet them to install it. You can install the modification at the same time that you meet its prerequisites.</p>\n<h3>Advanced Grounding System</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 13th level</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Prototype Grounding System</em></p>\n<p>While wearing your gadgeteer harness you have immunity to lightning damage.</p>\n<h3>Auto-Injection Regenerator</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 5th level</em></p>\n<p>You install a special kolto injector into your gadgeteer harness that can inject you with kolto in response to pain.

While wearing these goggles, you have darkvision to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, this modification increases its range by 30 feet.</p>\n<h3>Extended Tank</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 5th level</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Jet Pack</em></p>\n<p>Your jet pack now lasts up to 10 minutes when activated.</p>\n<h3>Flame Vents</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 9th level</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Jet Pack</em></p>\n<p>You learn the @Compendium[sw5e.techpowers.6aZ0FG6HwrUO28WF]{Flame Sweep} tech power and can cast it at first level without using tech points. Once you have used this ability, you cannot use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<p>Additionally, while your jet pack is active, you can cast <em>flame sweep</em> using your bonus action instead of your action.</p>\n<h3>Grounding System</h3>\n<p>While wearing your gadgeteer harness you are immune to the shocked condition.</p>\n<h3>Integrated Inhibitor</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 5th level</em></p>\n<p>You gain a +1 bonus to your tech save DC. This bonus increases to +2 at 9th level and +3 at 13th level.</p>\n<h3>Integrated Targeter</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 5th level</em></p>\n<p>You gain a +1 bonus to tech attack rolls.

Activating or deactivating the jets requires a bonus action and, while active, you have a flying speed of 30 feet.</p>\n<p>The jet pack lasts for 1 minute before deactivating. Once the jets have been activated, they can't be activated again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<h3>Mechanical Arm</h3>\n<p>You create a mechanical arm which mounts to your shoulder, which you can use independently. You can only gain the benefit of items held by two of your arms at any given time.</p>\n<p>You can choose this modification twice.</p>\n<h3>Mimicker</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 9th level</em></p>\n<p>You create a device that attaches to your gadgeteer harness. Your mimicker casts a shadow that makes you appear to be standing in a place near your actual location, causing any creature to have disadvantage on attack rolls against you. If you take damage, the property ceases to function for 1 minute. Your mimicker is suppressed while you are incapacitated, restrained, or otherwise unable to move.</p>\n<h3>Miniaturized Hydraulics</h3>\n<p>Your gadgeteer harness can store 20 pounds of equipment without adding to your encumbrance.</p>\n<h3>Oil Spill</h3>\n<p>As an action, you can cast the <em>oil slick</em> tech power without expending tech points. Casting the power in this way does not require concentration, and the oil will remain in place for the full duration of the power.</p>\n<p>Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p>\n<h3>Powered Grappling Hook</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 9th level</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Wrist-Mounted Grappling Hook</em></p>\n<p>While your wrist-mounted grappling hook is deployed, when you cast a tech power with a range of touch, your hook can deliver the power as if it had cast it.</p>\n<h3>Prototype Grounding System</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 9th level</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Grounding System</em></p>\n<p>While wearing your gadgeteer harness you have resistance to lightning damage.</p>\n<h3>Prototype Thruster</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 9th level</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Jet Pack</em></p>\n<p>While your jet pack is activated, your flying speed is now 45 feet.</p>\n<h3>Quick Start Engine</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 5th level</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Jet Pack</em></p>\n<p>You can now activate your Jet Pack as an object interaction rather than as a bonus action.</p>\n<h3>Recycled Adrenals</h3>\n<p>You can augment a single adrenal to regain its charge. This adrenal can only be used by you, and it can only affect you. Once you've used this adrenal, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<h3>Recycled Explosives</h3>\n<p>You can augment a single explosive to regain its charge. This explosive can only be used by you, and it uses your tech save DC instead of its own, unless its own DC would be higher. Once you've used this explosive, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<h3>Recycled Stimpacs</h3>\n<p>You can augment a single stimpac to regain its charge. This stimpac can only be used by you, and it can only affect you. Once you've used this stimpac, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<h3>Sentry Turret</h3>\n<p>You learn how to craft small sentry turrets shaped like globes that can adhere to any surface. As an action or bonus action (your choice), you can throw a sentry to a point you can see within range (30 feet + your Strength modifier x 5). At the end of each of your turns, a deployed sentry automatically targets a hostile creature within 10 feet of it. If multiple targets are available, one is chosen at random. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 1d4 energy damage and gains 1 slowed level until the end of your next turn. If a creature would be targeted by more than one of these sentries, it only makes this saving throw once, taking an additional d4 damage for each sentry beyond the first.</p>\n<p>The sentries have 1 hit point, an armor class of 10, and can be repaired over the course of a long rest. Each sentry lasts for 1 minute before deactivating. You can maintain a number of sentries equal to your Intelligence modifier. Once a sentry has been activated, it can't be activated again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<h3>Shocking Hook</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 9th level</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Wrist-Mounted Grappling Hook</em></p>\n<p>After hitting a creature with your grappling hook, you can use the connection to deliver an at-will tech power. As a bonus action, you can cast an at-will tech power at the target with a range of touch. If the power requires an attack roll, you have advantage. If the target requires a saving throw, the target has disadvantage.</p>\n<p>Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you recover the harpoon.</p>\n<h3>Stealth Field Generator</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 9th level</em></p>\n<p>You create an augmented belt that functions as a portable, personal cloaking device. Activating or deactivating the generator requires a bonus action and, while active, you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) ability checks that rely on sight. The generator lasts for 1 minute. This effect ends early if you make an attack or cast a force- or tech- power.</p>\n<p>Once the belt has been activated, it can't be activated again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<h3>Shocking Barrier</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 5th level</em></p>\n<p>You enhanced your barriers. Whenever a creature with one of your barriers active takes damage from a creature within 5 feet of it, the damaged creature can roll your Potent Aptitude die, dealing the result of the die as lightning damage to the creature that damaged it.</p>\n<h3>Truesight Goggles</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 11th level</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Darkvision Goggles</em></p>\n<p>You modify your goggles with a toggle allowing you to briefly gain enhanced sight. As a bonus action, you can activate the truesight feature of your goggles. When toggled on, for the next minute your goggles now automatically dispel illusions and can detect invisibility, as with truesight.</p>\n<p>Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p>\n<h3>Weapon Integration</h3>\n<p>You can integrate a single weapon that weighs no more than 8 lb. into your gadgeteer harness. While integrated, that weapon gains the hidden and fixed properties.</p>\n<h3>Wrist-Mounted Grappling Hook</h3>\n<p>You craft a wrist-mounted grappling hook weapon attached to a tightly coiled cord. With this contraption, you can make a ranged weapon attack with a range of 30/60. On a hit, it deals 1d4 kinetic damage. This attack can target a surface, object, or creature.</p>\n<p>A creature struck by this attack is impaled by the hook. As an action, a creature can attempt to remove the hook. Removing the hook requires a Strength check. While the hook is stuck in the target, you are connected to the target by a 60 foot cable.</p>\n<p>While the hook is deployed, you can use your bonus action to activate the reel, pulling yourself to the location if the target is your size or larger. A creature or object smaller than you is pulled to you. Alternatively, you can opt to release the cable (no action required).</p>\n<p>Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you recover and reinsert the hook as an action.</p>"},"source":"PHB","activation":{"cost":null,"type":""},"actionType":"","damage":{"parts":[]},"armorproperties":{"parts":[]},"weaponproperties":{"parts":[]},"classCasterType":"Techcaster"},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false}},"img":"systems/sw5e/packs/Icons/Archetypes/Gadgeteer%20Engineering.webp","effects":[]}

You delve into the secrets of the body, learning as much medical knowledge as you can get your hands on, regardless of how dirty the work becomes.</p>\n<h2>General Practice</h2>\n<p>When you choose this practice at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in Medicine, and you can use your Intelligence modifier instead of your Wisdom modifier for checks made with it.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you can expend one use of a medkit to help revitalize your wounded allies during a short rest. If you or any friendly creatures within 30 feet of you regain hit points at the end of the short rest by spending one or more Hit Dice, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points.</p>\n<p>The extra hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d8 at 9th level, to 1d10 at 13th level, and to 1d12 at 17th level.</p>\n<h2>Debilitating Strike</h2>\n<p>Also at 3rd level, you learn to apply your anatomical knowledge in direct combat, in order to hinder your targets.

The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>\n<p><strong>Debilitating Strike save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<h3>Bleeding Wound</h3>\n<p>You attempt to create a lingering wound in the target for one minute. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, at the start of each of the target's turns, it loses 1d6 hit points and repeats this saving throw, ending the effect on a success. This damage can't be reduced in any way.</p>\n<h3>Crippling Pain</h3>\n<p>You attempt to cause cause distracting pain in the target. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it has disadvantage on attack rolls until the end of your next turn.</p>\n<h3>Hampering Shot</h3>\n<p>You attempt to hamper the target's movement.

Over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a rest, you can carefully measure and mark out dosages of a medpac within reach. The medpac can now be used twice before it is consumed.</p>\n<p>At your DM's discretion, you may be able to use this feature on other pacs, stims, or adrenals, most likely involving an ability check to succeed.</p>\n<h2>Self-Sustain</h2>\n<p>At 17th level, you have advantage on death saving throws.</p>\n<p>Additionally, when you are stabilized, you regain 1 hit point.

Those scholars who choose the Politician Pursuit know how to best present themselves to manipulate the masses into doing their bidding or allow them and their allies to carry out their business without impediment. They also understand the importance of self-preservation for a political figure.</p>\n<h2>Silver Tongue</h2>\n<p>When you choose this pursuit at 3rd level, you learn one language of your choice. Additionally, you gain a bonus to your choice of Deception, Intimidation, Performance, or Persuasion equal to your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<h2>Motivating Diplomat</h2>\n<p>Also at 3rd level, when you are the target of your Critical Analysis feature, you and all allies within 10 feet of you gain a bonus to their AC equal to half your Intelligence modifier (rounded down).</p>\n<h2>Additional Maneuvers</h2>\n<p>Lastly at 3rd level, you gain access to new maneuvers which reflect the progress of your studies into the political world. Whenever you learn a new maneuver, you can choose from any of the following as well. The maneuvers are listed in alphabetical order.</p>\n<h3>Call to Arms</h3>\n<p>If you are surprised at the start of combat and aren't incapacitated, you can expend one superiority die to act normally. Additionally, on your first turn in combat, as a bonus action you can make a call to arms. When you do so, a number of creatures equal to the amount rolled on the superiority die that you choose within 30 feet who can see or hear you may act normally on their first turn.</p>\n<h3>Call the Guards</h3>\n<p>When a creature makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction and expend a superiority die and command a willing ally within 5 feet of that creature to use their reaction to intercede. The creature is then forced to make an attack on the ally instead. If the attack misses, the ally can immediately make a weapon attack against that creature as a part of that same reaction. Roll the superiority die, and add the result to the ally's attack roll.</p>\n<h3>Charge</h3>\n<p>As a bonus action on your turn, you can expend one superiority die to spurn your allies to move. Until the start of your next turn, creatures you choose within 10 feet of you who can see or hear you can move an additional distance equal to 5 times the superiority die rolled on their turn and ignore unenhanced difficult terrain.</p>\n<h3>Encouraging Speech</h3>\n<p>You can expend a superiority die to give an encouraging speech, spending the next minute rallying your allies. You grant a number of creature up to your Intelligence modifier temporary hit points equal to the amount rolled on the superiority die + your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<h3>Incite</h3>\n<p>On your turn, you can use an action and expend one superiority die to bolster the resolve of one of an ally. When you do so, choose an ally who can see or hear you within 30 feet of you. The ally can add your Intelligence modifier to every damage roll they make until the start of your next turn.</p>\n<h3>Overwhelming Presence</h3>\n<p>As an action, you can make a Charisma (Persuasion) or Charisma (Intimidation) skill check and expend one superiority die to attempt to charm or frighten a humanoid creature who can see or hear you within 60 feet. Add the superiority die to the roll. The target makes a contested Wisdom (Insight) check. If your check succeeds, the target is charmed by you if you used Persuasion, or frightened of you if you used Intimidation, until the end of your next turn.</p>\n<h3>Self-Preservation</h3>\n<p>As a reaction when you make a saving throw against an effect you can see, you can expend a superiority die and add the result. You can use this maneuver before or after making the saving throw, but before any effects of the saving throw are det-ermined.</p>\n<h3>Steady the Nerves</h3>\n<p>As an action, you can expend one superiority die to strengthen your allies' defences. Roll a superiority die. Until the end of your next turn, you and all allies within 5 feet of you when you use this action has a bonus to any saving throws they make equal to amount rolled.</p>\n<h3>Tyrannical Strike</h3>\n<p>When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die and use your reaction to issue a one-word command to a creature who can see or hear you. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target must follow the command on its next turn.</p>\n<p>The target automatically succeeds if it is immuned to charm, it doesn't understand your language, or if your command is directly harmful to it.</p>\n<h2>Force of Personality</h2>\n<p>Beginning at 6th level, as an action, you suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) to influence a creature you can see within range that can hear and understand you. Creatures that can't be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act ends the effect.</p>\n<p>The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your maneuver save DC. On a failed save, the target is charmed by you, and it pursues the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for up to 24 hours. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the effect ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.</p>\n<p>You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest that an officer givers her gun to the first smuggler she meets. If the condition isn't met before the effect ends, the activity isn't performed.</p>\n<p>If you or any of your companions damage the target, the effect ends.</p>\n<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<h2>Reassemble</h2>\n<p>Starting at 9th level, you may use to a bonus action to call your allies towards you. When you do so, choose a number of creatures that you can see within 60 feet of you equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one). They can use their reaction to immediately move directly towards you up to their movement speed. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks.</p>\n<p>Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p>\n<h2>Beguiling Presence</h2>\n<p>Once you've reach 17th level, humanoids within 60 feet are particularly susceptible to your presence. Humanoids within range have disadvantage on saving throws against any charm or fear effects from you.</p>\n<h2>Discoveries (Politician)</h2>\n<p>When you select this pursuit, you gain access to new discoveries which reflect the progress of your studies into the political world. Whenever you learn a new discovery, you can choose from any of the following as well. The discoveries are listed in alphabetical order.</p>\n<h3>Charming Feint</h3>\n<p>Allies within range of your Motivating Diplomat feature also gain a bonus to their damage roll equal to half your Intelligence modifier (rounded down).</p>\n<h3>Demanding Leader</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 5th level</em></p>\n<p>The range of each of your maneuvers increases by 10 feet. If the range is touch, it becomes 10 feet.</p>\n<h3>Dominating Presence</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 15th level</em></p>\n<p>As a bonus action, you can call out to a humanoid who can understand you that is charmed by you or frightened of you to direct their next action. The target must succeed a Wisdom saving throw against your maneuver save DC. On a failed save, until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn't do anything that you don't allow it to do.</p>\n<p>During this time you can use your reaction to force the creature to use its reaction.</p>\n<p>Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p>\n<h3>Influencer</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 5th level</em></p>\n<p>The range on the your Motivating Diplomat feature is increased to 15 feet.</p>\n<h3>Reliable Words</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 9th level</em></p>\n<p>When you make a Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion skill check, you may treat any roll 9 or lower as if you had rolled a 10.</p>\n<h3>Social Opportunist</h3>\n<p>You can add half your proficiency bonus (rounded down) to any Charisma check you make that doesn't already include your proficiency bonus.</p>\n<h3>Tyrant's Ferocity</h3>\n<p>You have advantage on any attack against a creature that is charmed by you or frightened of you.</p>"},"source":"PHB","activation":{"cost":null,"type":""},"actionType":"","damage":{"parts":[]},"armorproperties":{"parts":[]},"weaponproperties":{"parts":[]},"classCasterType":""},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false}},"img":"systems/sw5e/packs/Icons/Archetypes/Politician%20Pursuit.webp","effects":[]}

Additionally, you can use Intelligence instead of Charisma when you make a Performance check while wielding your modified instrument.</p>\n<h2>Modified Instrument</h2>\n<p>Also at 3rd level, you learn to modify an instrument utilizing your audiotech knowledge. Over the course of a long rest, you can expend 500 cr worth of materials to modify a single instrument. You must have the instrument, materials, and tinker's tools in order to perform this modification.</p>\n<p>Your modified instrument is enhanced, requires attunement, can only be used by you, and counts as a tech focus for your tech powers while you are attuned to it. Your modified instrument has 4 modification slots, and it gains more at higher levels, as shown in the Modification Slots column of the engineer class table. For each modification installed, your tech point maximum is reduced by 1.

If you take damage from multiple sources, you must make a separate saving throw for each source of damage.</p>\n<p>When you cast a damage dealing tech power while playing your song that requires an attack roll or saving throw, you can cause that power to instead deal sonic damage. If you do so, instead of an attack roll or saving throw, the power instead requires a Constitution saving throw.</p>\n<p>Your song ends early if you are incapacitated or die, or if you are no longer holding your modified instrument.</p>\n<p>You can initiate playing an enhanced song twice.

As an action, you can end your enhanced song in a triumphant blast of power with an effect determined by the song you are playing.</p>\n<p>Once you've used this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.</p>\n<h3>Battle Crescendo</h3>\n<p>Choose up to 10 creatures of your choice that you can see and that can hear your song. Each must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 14d6 sonic damage and is stunned. On a success, it takes half damage and isn't stunned. If a creature is killed by this power, its head explodes.</p>\n<h3>Support Crescendo</h3>\n<p>Choose up to 10 creatures of your choice that you can see and that can hear your song. Once in the next minute, each creature can, as a free action in response to taking damage, choose to halve that damage. Additionally, if the damage would reduce them to 0 hit points, they are instead reduced to 1.</p>\n<h3>Disruption Crescendo</h3>\n<p>Choose up to 10 creatures of your choice that you can see and that can hear your song. Each creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1d4+1 turns. If a creature affected by this feature is damaged in any way, the effect ends for that creature.</p>\n<h2>Audiotech Modifications</h2>\n<p>If a modification has prerequisites, you must meet them to install it.

On a failed save, it can't attack you on this turn, and it must choose a new target for its attack or the attack is wasted. On a successful save, it can attack you on this turn, but it has disadvantage on any saving throw it makes against your powers or features on your next turn.</p>\n<p>Once you've used this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.</p>\n<h3>Finding My Way</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Rush</em> <br />While you are playing an enhanced song, when a creature makes a melee attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to move 5 feet without provoking opportunity attacks, imposing disadvantage on the roll.</p>\n<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once).

Choose a number of creature up to your Intelligence modifier. If those creatures listen to this song for a full minute, they must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by you for 1 minute. Creatures that succeed the saving throw are not aware that you attempted to influence them, nor are creatures that failed their saving throw once the power ends.</p>\n<p>Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<h3>Inaudible Casting</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 7th level</em> <br /><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Simple Melodies</em> <br />When you cast a tech power or make use of a feature that requires playing your modified instrument, you can choose to do so quietly.

If it can hear you, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 1d4 sonic damage and have disadvantage on its next attack roll before the end of its next turn.</p>\n<p>This feature's damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and 17th level (4d4).</p>\n<h3>Shock Mount</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 5th level</em> <br />You gain a +1 bonus to your tech save DC. This bonus increases to +2 at 11th level and +3 at 17th level.</p>\n<h3>Simple Melodies</h3>\n<p>When you are holding your modified instrument, and not actively playing a song, any tech power that you could cast that could have its damage type altered by your Potent Amplitude feature can be cast as if used with Potent Amplitude.</p>\n<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest.</p>\n<h3>Sonar Pulse</h3>\n<p>As an action while wielding your modified instrument, you can release a wave of sound that provides feedback on your surroundings.

If the original attack roll would hit the second target, it takes two dice worth of Sneak Attack damage.</p>\n<p>The damage is of the same type dealt by the original attack.</p>\n<h3>Suppressive Shot</h3>\n<p>You attempt to pin the target to its location. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you until the end of its next turn.</p>\n<h2>Head Shot</h2>\n<p>At 9th level, you are at your deadliest when your enemies are unaware of the danger they are in. You have advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn in combat yet.</p>\n<p>Additionally, any hit you score against a creature that is surprised is a critical hit.</p>\n<h2>Distracting Shot</h2>\n<p>Starting at 13th level, you are able to defend your compatriots from afar. When a friendly creature you can see within your weapon's normal range is the target of a ranged attack, or forced to make a saving throw, and the source of the effect is within your weapon's normal range, you can use your reaction to make a ranged weapon attack against the source. On a hit, instead of dealing damage, the target of your attack has disadvantage on the attack roll against your ally, or your ally has advantage on the saving throw to resist the effect.</p>\n<h2>Double Tap</h2>\n<p>At 17th level, you've learned to capitalize when you have the advantage. When you take the Attack action and make an attack with advantage, you can choose to forgo the advantage. If you do, you can make an additional attack against the target or another creature within 5 feet of it (no action required). Both attacks can benefit from your Sneak Attack damage, instead of only one.</p>"},"source":"PHB","activation":{"cost":null,"type":""},"actionType":"","damage":{"parts":[]},"armorproperties":{"parts":[]},"weaponproperties":{"parts":[]},"classCasterType":""},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false}},"img":"systems/sw5e/packs/Icons/Archetypes/Sharpshooter%20Practice.webp","effects":[]}

While in this stance, the first time you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack on your turn, it has disadvantage on the next melee attack roll it makes against you before the start of your next turn. Additionally, if that creature is within 5 feet of you, it must make a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier). On a failed save, it is pushed back 5 feet, and you can immediately move into the space it just vacated without provoking opportunity attacks.</p>\n<p>This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or die.

If the attack hits, you can attempt to damage another creature within 5 feet of the original target and within your reach. If the original attack roll would hit the second creature, it takes damage equal to your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice). The damage is of the same type dealt by the original attack.</p>\n<h2>Master of Determination</h2>\n<p>At 20th level, the erratic fluidity of your movement confounds even the most determined of foes. Your Strength or Dexterity and Wisdom or Charisma scores (your choice) increase by 2. Your maximum for these scores increases by 2.

With their deep understanding of both their weapon and how to manipulate its ammunition on the fly, they can often turn the tides of a battle with a single shot.</p>\n<h2>Studied Shooter</h2>\n<p>When you choose this specialty at 3rd level, you learn specialized theory typical for practitioners of the enhancement trade. You gain proficiency in your choice of the Lore or Technology skills. Additionally, you learn your choice of the <em>encrypted message</em> or <em>minor image</em> tech power. Intelligence is your techcasting ability for these powers.</p>\n<h2>Special Ammunition</h2>\n<p>Also at 3rd level, you learn ammunition enhancements that are fueled by amplified shots to unleash special enhanced effects.</p>\n<h3>Ammunition Enhancements</h3>\n<p>You know two ammunition enhancements of your choice, which are detailed under \"Ammunition Enhancements\" below, and you earn more at higher levels. Many ammunition enhancements boost an attack in some way. Once per turn when you fire a shot from a blaster as part of the Attack action, you can apply one of your Ammunition Enhancement options to that shot,</p>\n<p>You gain an additional Ammunition Enhancement option of your choice when you reach certain levels in this class: 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level. Each option also improves when you become an 18th-level fighter.</p>\n<p>Each time you learn new ammunition enhancements, you can also replace one ammunition enhancement you know with a different one.</p>\n<h3>Amplified Shots</h3>\n<p>You have two amplified shots, which you use to activate your ammunition enhancements. An amplified shot is expended when you use it. When you fire an amplified shot, your weapon is treated as enhanced for overcoming resistance and immunity to unenhanced attacks and damage. You decide to use the option when the shot hits a creature, unless the option doesn't involve an attack roll. You regain all of your amplified shots when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<h3>Saving Throws</h3>\n<p>Some of your ammunition enhancements require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>\n<p><strong>Ammunition save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier</p>\n<h2>Ammunition Enhancements</h2>\n<p>The ammunition enhancements are presented in alphabetical order.</p>\n<h3>Carbonite Shot</h3>\n<p>When this shot strikes its target, shards of carbonite wrap around the target. The creature hit by the shot takes an extra 2d6 cold damage, its speed is reduced by 10 feet, and it takes 2d6 kinetic damage the first time on each turn it moves 1 foot or more without teleporting. The target or any creature that can reach it can use its action to remove the carbonite with a successful Strength (Athletics) check against your Special Ammunition save DC. Otherwise, the carbonite lasts for 1 minute or until you use this option again.</p>\n<p>The cold damage and kinetic damage both increase to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.</p>\n<h3>Coercing Shot</h3>\n<p>You enhance your shot with chemicals that confuse the target. The creature hit by the shot takes an extra 2d6 poison damage, and choose one of your allies within 30 feet of the target. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or it is charmed by the chosen ally until the start of your next turn. This effect ends early if the chosen ally attacks the charmed target, deals damage to it, or forces it to make a saving throw.</p>\n<p>The poison damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.</p>\n<h3>Explosive Shot</h3>\n<p>You fire a shot set to explode on impact. The shot detonates after your attack. Immediately after the shot hits the creature, the target and all other creatures within 10 feet of it take 2d6 fire damage each.</p>\n<p>The fire damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.</p>\n<h3>Hallucinogen Shot</h3>\n<p>You enhance your shot with hallucinogenic chemicals. The creature hit by the shot takes an extra 2d6 psychic damage, and it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be unable to see anything farther than 5 feet away until the start of your next turn.</p>\n<p>The psychic damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.</p>\n<h3>Piercing Shot</h3>\n<p>You enhance your shot with armor-piercing properties. When you use this option, you don't make an attack roll for the attack. Instead, the shot shoots forward in a line, which is 1 foot wide and 30 feet long, before disappearing. The shot passes through objects, ignoring cover. Each creature in that line must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes damage as if it were hit by the shot, plus an extra 1d6 damage of the weapon's type. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage.</p>\n<p>The extra damage increases to 2d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.</p>\n<h3>Quell Shot</h3>\n<p>You fire a shot enhanced with a debilitating poison. The creature hit by the shot takes an extra 2d6 poison damage. The target must also succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or the damage dealt by its weapon attacks is halved until the start of your next turn.</p>\n<p>The poison damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.</p>\n<h3>Seeking Shot</h3>\n<p>You apply a tracing signal to your shot. When you use this option, you don't make an attack roll for the attack. Instead, choose one creature you have seen in the past minute. The shot flies toward that creature, moving around corners if necessary and ignoring three-quarters cover and half cover. If the target is within the weapon's range and there is a path large enough for the shot to travel to the target, the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. Otherwise, the shot disappears after traveling as far as it can. On a failed save, the target takes damage as if it were hit by the shot, plus an extra 1d6 kinetic damage, and you learn the target's current location. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage, and you don't learn its location.</p>\n<p>The kinetic damage increases to 2d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.</p>\n<h2>Enhanced Shot</h2>\n<p>Beginning at 7th level, you gain the ability to enhance your shots. Whenever you fire an unenhanced shot from a blaster, you can make it enhanced for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to unenhanced attacks and damage.</p>\n<h2>Redirected Shot</h2>\n<p>At 10th level, you learn how to direct an errant shot toward a new target. When you make an attack roll with an enhanced shot and miss, you can use a bonus action to reroll the attack roll against a different target within 60 feet of the original target.</p>\n<h2>Ever-Ready Shot</h2>\n<p>Starting at 15th level, your enhanced ammunition is available whenever battle starts. If you roll initiative and have no uses of Special Ammunition remaining, you regain one use of it.</p>\n<h2>Ammunition Upgrades</h2>\n<p>At 18th level, your ammunition enhancements improve.</p>"},"source":"EC","activation":{"cost":null,"type":""},"actionType":"","damage":{"parts":[]},"armorproperties":{"parts":[]},"weaponproperties":{"parts":[]},"classCasterType":""},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false}},"img":"systems/sw5e/packs/Icons/Archetypes/Enhancement%20Specialist.webp","effects":[]}

At the start of each of its turns, a creature that consumes this food must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it subtracts the result of your superiority die from the first damage roll it makes before the start of its next turn. The effect of this maneuver ends when the creature completes its next long rest or 24 hours have passed. This maneuver has no effect on droids or constructs.</p>\n<h3>Supplements</h3>\n<p>At the end of a short or long rest you may expend a superiority die and choose a number of friendly creatures up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one), if they ate food you prepared. Once before the end of their next short or long rest, affected targets may add the result of the superiority die to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use this feature, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. This maneuver has no effect on droids or constructs.</p>\n<h3>Vitamins</h3>\n<p>At the end of a short or long rest you may expend a superiority die and choose a number of friendly creatures up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one), if they ate food you prepared. Each creature gains proficiency in Constitution saving throws until the end of their next short or long rest. If a creature was already proficient in Constitution saving throws, they instead become proficient in a saving throw of your choice. This maneuver has no effect on droids or constructs.</p>\n<h2>Balanced Diet</h2>\n<p>Beginning at 6th level, your cooking is so nutritionally balanced that it allows allies to stave off the effects of continued rigorous activity. Creatures of your choice who eat food prepared by you have advantage on Constitution saving throws to avoid Exhaustion, as described in chapter 8, until the end of their next long rest.</p>\n<h2>Comfort Food</h2>\n<p>Starting at 9th level, if you or any friendly creatures who have consumed food you prepared during a short rest regain hit points by spending hit dice at the end of the short rest, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d8 hit points.</p>\n<p>The extra hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d10 at 11th level, and to 1d12 at 15th level.</p>\n<h2>Heroes' Feast</h2>\n<p>Once you've reached 17th level, you have developed a signature feast that is the purest distillation of your knowledge and talent as a chef.</p>\n<p>Over the course of a long rest, you can expend rare culinary supplies worth 1,000 cr to create your feast, which can feed a number of creatures equal to twice your Intelligence modifier. Any creature partaking in the feast gains the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It is cured of all poisons and disease, and becomes immune to poison and disease.</li>\n<li>It makes Wisdom saving throws to avoid being frightened with advantage.</li>\n<li>Its hit point maximum and current hit points increase by 2d10.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These benefits last until the end of the creature's next long rest or 24 hours have passed. This feature has no effect on droids or constructs.</p>\n<h2>Discoveries (Chef)</h2>\n<p>When you select this pursuit, you gain access to new discoveries which reflect the progress of your studies into the culinary arts. Whenever you learn a new discovery, you can choose from any of the following as well. The discoveries are listed in alphabetical order.</p>\n<h3>Alternative Fuel</h3>\n<p>Any of your chef features, maneuvers, or discoveries can now effect droids and constructs.</p>\n<h3>Banquet</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 17th level, </em><em>Full Course</em></p>\n<p>Over the course of a long or short rest, you may utilize an additional maneuver from this archetype (total of four).</p>\n<h3>Filling Meal</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 7th level</em></p>\n<p>Over the course of a long or short rest, you may utilize up to two different maneuvers from this archetype, rather than one.</p>\n<h3>Full Course</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 12th level, </em><em>Filling Meal</em></p>\n<p>Over the course of a long or short rest, you may utilize an additional maneuver from this archetype (total of three).</p>\n<h3>On the Rocks</h3>\n<p>Any food you prepare over a short or long rest carries with it an additional cooling effect. Creatures that consume it are considered adapted to hot climates, as described in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide, until the end of the creature's next long rest or 24 hours have passed. Additionally, the first time a creature who eats your food takes fire damage before the end of their next short or long rest, they are considered resistant to the damage.</p>\n<h3>Secret Ingredient</h3>\n<p>If you or any friendly creature that has consumed food made by you during their last short or long rest gains temporary hit points, the number of temporary hit points they gain increases by an amount equal to your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<h3>Spice of Life</h3>\n<p>Any food you prepare over a short or long rest carries with it an additional warming effect. Creatures that consume it are considered adapted to cold climates, as described in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide, until the end of the creature's next long rest or 24 hours have passed. Additionally, the first time a creature who eats your food takes cold damage before the end of their next short or long rest, they are considered resistant to the damage.</p>"},"source":"EC","activation":{"cost":null,"type":""},"actionType":"","damage":{"parts":[]},"armorproperties":{"parts":[]},"weaponproperties":{"parts":[]},"classCasterType":""},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false}},"img":"systems/sw5e/packs/Icons/Archetypes/Chef%20Pursuit.webp","effects":[]}

Over the course of 8 hours, which can be done during a long rest, you can expend 500 cr worth of materials to finally finish your tracker droid.</p>\n<p>If your tracker droid is irreparable destroyed, or you want to interface with a different tracker droid, you can spend an additional 250 credits and 1 hour to change the target of this feature. You may only have one tracker droid companion at a time.</p>\n<p>Your tracker droid gains a variety of benefits while it is interfaced with you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The tracker droid obeys your commands as best it can. It acts on your turn, and you determine its actions, decisions, attitudes, and so on. If you are incapacitated or absent, your tracker droid acts on its own.</li>\n<li>Your tracker droid's level equals your operative level, and for each operative level you gain after 3rd, your tracker droid companion gains an additional Hit Die and increases its hit points accordingly.</li>\n<li>Your tracker droid has the proficiency bonus of a player character of the same level.</li>\n<li>Whenever you gain the Ability Score Improvement feature in this class, your tracker droid's abilities also improve.

Each creature within 5 feet of your tracker droid must make a Constitution saving throw against your tech save DC. A creature takes 1d4 ion damage for each Hit Die expended in this way on a failed save, or half as much as on a successful one. Any electronics not being worn or carried within the blast radius are disabled until rebooted.</p>\n<h3>Saboteur Practice Techcasting</h3>\n<h2>Sabotage</h2>\n<p>At 17th level, you gain the ability to sabotage a tech power in the process of being cast. When a hostile creature casts a tech power, and you are the target of the tech power or within its area of effect, you can use your reaction to force that creature to make an Intelligence saving throw against your tech save DC. On a successful save, the power is cast as normal.</p>\n<p>On a failed save, you negate the power's effects, and the caster takes 1d6 lightning damage per level of the power it was casting. Additionally, on a failed save, the caster's tech focus used to cast the tech power is overloaded and can't be used to cast tech powers for 1 minute.</p>\n<p>At the end of each of the caster's turns, it can repeat the Intelligence saving throw.

If the result of your ability check plus the superiority die is within a range equal to half your proficiency bonus (rounded down) above or below the check's DC, you pass the check instead.</p>\n<h3>Double Bluff</h3>\n<p>If on the same round of combat that you have missed a weapon attack, an enemy also misses you with a weapon attack, you can expend a superiority die and make a single weapon attack, adding the results of your superiority die to both the attack and damage rolls.</p>\n<h3>The Idiot's Array</h3>\n<p>When a creature hits you with a weapon attack roll, you can expend a superiority die and roll it. On a roll of 4 or higher, you take minimum damage on the damage roll and subtract the value of the superiority die. On a roll of 3 or lower, you instead take the maximum.</p>\n<h3>Played Their Hand</h3>\n<p>When a creature hits you with an opportunity attack while within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction and expend a superiority die to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. If the attack misses, you can make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check contested by the attacker's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (their choice) as a part of this reaction. On a success, the target drops the weapon it made the attack with. If you are within 5 feet of the target, and you have a free hand, you can catch the item. Otherwise, the object lands at its feet.</p>\n<h3>Pure Sabacc</h3>\n<p>When you score a critical hit with a weapon attack, you can expend a superiority die and roll it. On a roll of 4 or higher, you deal maximum damage on the weapon's damage roll, including the superiority die. On a roll of 3 or lower, you instead deal the minimum.</p>\n<h3>Raise the Stakes</h3>\n<p>When the target of your Critical Analysis feature makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to expend a superiority die. Roll the die and subtract the result from the enemy's attack roll, but add the result to their damage roll on a hit.</p>\n<h3>Take a Chance</h3>\n<p>Before making an attack roll, you can expend a superiority die. On a miss, you lose that superiority die and do not benefit from it in any way. On a hit, you can choose two other maneuvers that you know, and subject the target to both maneuvers, without expending additional superiority dice.</p>\n<h3>Tiebreaker</h3>\n<p>When you roll a superiority die as a part of a maneuver you learned from this class, you can expend another superiority die and use the total of both dice.</p>\n<h2>Lucky Number 7</h2>\n<p>Beginning at 6th level, whenever you roll a 7 on an attack roll against the target of your Critical Analysis feature, the attack automatically hits and you regain a superiority die. You can not have more superiority dice than the amount shown in the Superiority Dice column of the Scholar class table.</p>\n<p>When attacking with advantage or disadvantage, this effect applies if either roll is a 7. If both rolls are a 7, the attack is a critical hit.</p>\n<h2>Tell Me the Odds</h2>\n<p>Starting at 9th level, if the target of your Critical Analysis hits you with a weapon attack roll, you can use your reaction to roll a d8. On a 4 or higher, you impose disadvantage on the roll. If the target already had disadvantage, they must instead reroll one of the dice once (your choice).</p>\n<p>This die increases when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d10 at 11th level, and to 1d12 at 15th level.</p>\n<h2>Borrowed Luck</h2>\n<p>Once you've reached 17th level, you have gained the ability to unnaturally alter luck in your favor. Once per round, after an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check is rolled by you or a creature that you can see, you can replace the number on the d20 with a 7. Note the number on the d20 of the roll that you replaced. That number becomes your borrowed luck roll.</p>\n<p>While you have a borrowed luck roll, you can expend it and replace any ability check, attack roll, or saving throw made by you or a creature that you can see with the value of the borrowed luck roll. You can only have one borrowed luck roll at a time, and you lose any unused borrowed luck rolls when you complete a short or long rest.</p>\n<h2>Discoveries (Gambler)</h2>\n<p>When you select this pursuit, you gain access to new discoveries which reflect your deep understanding of chance. Whenever you learn a new discovery, you can choose from any of the following as well. The discoveries are listed in alphabetical order.</p>\n<h3>Ace Up Your Sleeve</h3>\n<p>Whenever you make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) or Charisma (Deception) check, you can expend a superiority die, adding the result to your total for the check.</p>\n<h3>Against the House</h3>\n<p>Whenever you would make a Charisma (Persuasion) check involving haggling, you can instead challenge the target to a game of chance. If they accept your offer, you can make an ability check with an available gaming set. If you win the challenge, you automatically succeed on the Charisma (Persuasion) check.</p>\n<h3>Ante Up</h3>\n<p>When you roll initiative, are not surprised, and end up first in the initiative order, you can take one additional action on top of your regular action and a possible bonus action during your first turn in combat.</p>\n<h3>Calculated Bluff</h3>\n<p>When you make an ability check using your Charisma, you can choose to instead make the check using your Intelligence.</p>\n<h3>Cold Read</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 5th level</em></p>\n<p>As an action, you may make a Wisdom (Insight) check contested by a target's Charisma (Deception) check. On a success, you know the next action the target intends to take, so long as the situation does not change dramatically.</p>\n<h3>Feeling the Pressure</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 13th level</em></p>\n<p>Whenever you roll a 4 or higher on your Risk Versus Reward feature, the target of your Critical Analysis feature also has disadvantage on attack rolls made against you until the start of your next turn.</p>\n<h3>The Magic Number</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 7th level</em></p>\n<p>Whenever you roll a 7 on an ability check or saving throw, you can reroll the ability check or saving throw with advantage.</p>"},"source":"EC","activation":{"cost":null,"type":""},"actionType":"","damage":{"parts":[]},"armorproperties":{"parts":[]},"weaponproperties":{"parts":[]},"classCasterType":""},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false}},"img":"systems/sw5e/packs/Icons/Archetypes/Gambler%20Pursuit.webp","effects":[]}

These portals last until the start of your next turn, and they are large enough to accommodate Medium and smaller creatures and objects. Portals take the appearance of an elongated, shimmering mirror, and looking through a portal, a creature can see through the linked portal as if looking through a window. A creature or object who passes through a portal immediately appears in a space within 5 feet of the linked portal. You can use your reaction to end your portals early. If a creature is partially within your portals, it is shunted back to the space it previously occupied and it must make a Dexterity saving throw against your tech save DC. On a failed save, it takes energy damage equal to your scout level + your intelligence modifier.</p>\n<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest. At the beginning of each of your turns, while you have a pair of portals active, you can expend a use of this feature to extend the duration of the portals until the start of your next turn (no action required).</p>\n<p>The distance at which you can create portals increases at higher levels. It increases to 60 feet at 5th level, 90 feet at 9th level, 150 feet at 13th level, 300 feet at 17th level, and 1,000 feet at 20th level.</p>\n<h2>Mark of the Teleporter</h2>\n<p>Also at 3rd level, on your turn, when you deal damage to the target of your Ranger's Quarry, and either you, your weapon, or the source of your damage have passed through the portal on this turn, when you roll below half the maximum on a damage die, you can treat the roll as if you'd rolled half the maximum on the damage die. You can only affect a number of dice up to half your intelligence modifier (rounded up) in this way.</p>\n<h2>Residual Warp</h2>\n<p>Beginning at 7th level, when you use your Personal Teleporter feature, you can place your portal in a place you've visited in the last 10 minutes, provided you can remember it, as opposed to a place you can see. That place must still be within range of your teleporter.</p>\n<h2>Quantum Entanglement</h2>\n<p>Starting at 11th level, when you use your Personal Teleporter feature, you can place the portal that you would normally place within 5 feet of you in a place you can see within your Personal Teleporter's range. If that space is occupied by a Huge or smaller creature or a Medium or smaller unsecured object, it must make a Dexterity saving throw against your tech save DC. An object automatically fails this saving throw, and a creature can choose to fail. On a failed save, a Medium or smaller creature or object falls through the portal, immediately appearing in a space within 5 feet of the linked portal and falling prone. A Large or Huge creature, instead, falls prone without moving.</p>\n<h2>Reprisal</h2>\n<p>At 15th level, when you would be affected by a weapon or tech power that requires a Dexterity saving throw or attack roll and would affect only you, you can use your reaction to instantaneously create a pair of portals to redirect that power to another target within 30 feet. If the weapon or power required a melee or ranged attack roll, make a melee or ranged tech attack roll against the new target, as appropriate. If it required a Dexterity saving throw, the new target must make a Dexterity saving throw against your tech save DC.</p>\n<p>Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p>"},"source":"EC","damage":{"parts":[]},"armorproperties":{"parts":[]},"weaponproperties":{"parts":[]},"classCasterType":"Techcaster"},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/sw5e/packs/Icons/Archetypes/Teleportation%20Technique.webp","effects":[]}

The discoveries are listed in alphabetical order.</p>\n<h3>Administrator's Log</h3>\n<p>If you spend at least 10 minutes working on a computer or terminal, you can get a full list of users who have accessed the machine within the past 24 hours. Over the course of a long rest, you may then form a facsimile of identification that would allow you to pass yourself off as that person when accessing machines.</p>\n<h3>Backdoor Egress</h3>\n<p>When you cast a tech power that affects an area and requires a saving throw, and you are inside that power's area, you can use your reaction to move up to half your speed without provoking opportunity attacks. If you end this movement outside the area affected by the tech power, you do not have to make a saving throw to avoid its effects.</p>\n<h3>Intelligence Core Override</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 9th level</em></p>\n<p>You can cast the @Compendium[sw5e.techpowers.NagD6z90jRyd7zOk]{Override Interface} tech power at 5th level without spending tech points.</p>\n<p>Once you've used this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.</p>\n<h3>Resource Appropriation</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 11th level</em></p>\n<p>If you reduce the target of your Critical Analysis feature to 0 hit points, and it has tech point remaining, you may choose to gain any tech points it had remaining. Your current tech points cannot exceed your tech point maximum.</p>\n<p>Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p>\n<h3>Skillful Casting</h3>\n<p>When you hit a creature with an at-will tech power that requires an attack roll, you may treat that attack roll as a weapon attack for the purpose of using maneuvers.</p>\n<h3>Sleeper Program</h3>\n<p>Whenever you cast a tech power with a casting time of 1 action, you can choose to delay the power's activation up to a minute. When you do so, you cast the power as normal, but holds its energy for the duration of the delay. Holding onto the power's effect requires concentration. If your concentration is broken before the delay ends, the power dissipates without taking effect. You can use your reaction to activate the power at any time.</p>\n<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once).

Choose two tech powers of 1st-level or lower. The chosen powers count as universal force powers for you, but are not included in the number in the Powers Known column of the sentinel class table. You still require the aid of a wristpad for these powers.</p>\n<p>At 7th-level, you learn two tech powers of 2nd-level or lower. At 13th level, you learn two tech powers of 3rd-level or lower. At 17th level, you learn two tech powers of 4th-level or lower. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the tech powers you know and replace it with another tech power.</p>\n<h2>Synthetic Understanding</h2>\n<p>Also at 3rd level, you've applied your newfound knowledge to broader pursuits. You gain proficiency in Technology or one tool of your choice.</p>\n<p>Additionally, when you make an Intelligence (Technology) check, or a check with a tool, you may use your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice) instead of your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<p>Finally, when you deal damage with a tech power or Kinetic Combat attack, you can choose to substitute the damage dealt as ion.</p>\n<h2>Force-Empowered Tech</h2>\n<p>At 7th level, you learn to fully blend your technological aptitude with your use of the Force. You have three such effects: Disruption Pulse, Force Override, and Techcasting Insight. When you use your Force-Empowered Tech, you choose which effect to create.</p>\n<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<h3>Disruption Pulse</h3>\n<p>As an action, you can send out a 30 foot cone of electromagnetically-charged energy to overload enemy weapons. Each creature within the cone that is wearing or carrying a weapon with electric components must make an Intelligence saving throw. If the weapon is being worn, this save is made with disadvantage. On a failed save, the first attack they attempt to make with that weapon has disadvantage. A creature with multiple weapons must make a separate save for each weapon.</p>\n<h3>Forced Override</h3>\n<p>When you cast a tech power that requires a saving throw, you can impose disadvantage on the save (no action required).</p>\n<h3>Techcasting Insight</h3>\n<p>As an action, you can attempt to determine another creature's experience with techcasting. When you do so, you make an Intelligence (Technology) check contested by the target's Intelligence (Technology) check. If you succeed, you immediately learn the target's techcasting Max Power Level, as well as any tech powers currently affecting the target.</p>\n<h2>Improved Force-Empowered Tech</h2>\n<p>By 13th level, you've gained access to two additional Force-Empowered Tech effects: Harmonic Synthesis and Conservation of Energy.</p>\n<h3>Harmonic Synthesis</h3>\n<p>When you use your action to cast a force power, you can use your bonus action to gain resistance to damage dealt by tech powers until the start of your next turn. If you use your action to cast a tech power, you can instead gain resistance to damage dealt by force powers.</p>\n<h3>Conservation of Energy</h3>\n<p>When you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points with a tech power, you can reduce the force point cost of the tech power to 0 (no action required).</p>\n<h2>Reflective Shield</h2>\n<p>At 18th level, when you use your Force-Empowered Tech features, a barrier for energy shimmers into existence, surrounding you until the end of your next turn. When you take damage, you can mitigate the incoming energy and potentially reflect it back at your attacker.

Over the course of a long rest, you create a portable structure that travels with you.</p>\n<p>Your portable structure can only be directed by you, and you must have a tech focus in order to direct it remotely. If you lack a tech focus, you can instead direct it while it is within 5 feet of you. Your portable structure has the following features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Its AC equals your tech save DC.</li>\n<li>It has a number of hit points equal to 5 x your engineer level. If your structure is reduced to 0 hit points, it collapses and can't be use again until you spend 1 hour repairing it. which can be done during a short or long rest.</li>\n<li>You can restore missing hit points to your structure by casting the mending tech power on it. or by completing a short or long rest.

Completing a short rest restores your structure to half its hit point maximum, and completing a long rest restores it to its hit point maximum.</li>\n<li>Your structure has two modes: dismantled and deployed. While dismantled, your structure's speed equals your own, it hovers 5 feet off the ground, it up the space a 5 foot cube, and it weighs 500 lbs. This increases to a 10 foot cube and 1,000 lbs. at 11 th level, and a 15 foot cube and 2,000 lbs. at 17th level as you upgrade it. While deployed, your structure's speed is 0 and it takes up space dictated by how its deployed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As an action, you can remotely deploy your structure at a space you can see on the ground within 30 feet of you, provided there is sufficient space to support it. This range increases to 60 feet at 11 th level and 120 feet at 17th level. Automatic dismantling of your structure takes 1 minute, and can be initiated on your turn (no action required).</p>\n<p>You can deploy your choice from these structures a combined total of four times, and you gain more uses at higher levels, as shown in the Modification Slots column of the engineer table. Each time you use this feature in excess of your proficiency bonus, your tech point maximum is reduced by 1 until you complete a long rest. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.</p>\n<h3>Bridge</h3>\n<p>You deploy a bridge up to 30 feet long, 10 feet wide, and 3 feet thick. The bridge starts from the point at which you deploy it, and extends in a direction of your choice. When you dismantle your bridge, it retracts to the point at which you initially deployed it. Both ends of the bridge must be supported in some function; one end cannot be suspended in the air or on unstable terrain. The bridge can hold up to 1,000 lbs., any weight above which causes the bridge to instantly drop to 0 hit points, destroying it. If a creature is on the bridge when it is destroyed or dismantled, it must make a Dexterity saving throw against your tech save DC. On a successful saving throw, it reaches the closest part of the bridge that has stable support, or it maintains a grip on your bridge as it retracts, as appropriate. On a failed save, it falls.</p>\n<p>When you reach 11th level, the bridge can now extend up to 45 feet long, 15 feet wide, and it can support up to 2,000 lbs.

Otherwise, the space within the cube is in complete darkness. The cage is permeable, as air, water, and sound passes through it You can attempt to trap unwilling Medium or smaller creatures inside the cage. When you deploy this structure in an unwilling creature's space, it must make a Dexterity saving throw against your tech save DC. On a successful save, it can immediately move to nearest unoccupied space outside the sage. Otherwise, it is trapped within the structure when it is deployed.</p>\n<p>When you reach 11th level, the cage can extend up to 15 feet on each side, and it can trap creatures of Large size or smaller. When you reach 17th level, the cage can extend up to 20 feet on each side, and it can trap creatures of Huge size or smaller.</p>\n<h3>Shelter</h3>\n<p>You erect a shelter up to 15 feet long, 10 feet wide, 10 feet tall, with one-foot-thick walls, a roof, and a floor. It has a single door along its walls in a location of your choice. The building has temperature control and lighting systems, and can withstand harsh winds, heavy rain and snow. Any creature inside the shelter is protected from hazardous environmental effects outside the shelter such as extreme heat or cold. The structure does not provide additional breathing air for anyone inside if the environment it is placed in is not breathable. The house can comfortably support up to 5 Medium creatures. For each Medium creature, it can instead support 2 Small creatures.

For each Small creature, it can instead support 2 Tiny creatures. Additionally, when a creature completes a long rest while within your shelter, their exhaustion level is reduced by 2, instead of only 1.</p>\n<h3>Tower</h3>\n<p>You erect a tower from a 5-foot square platform centered on the target location that rises up to 30 feet. If the tower is created under a creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be lifted by the tower. A creature can choose to fail the save. The tower comes equipped with a ladder that reaches from the ground to the platform.</p>\n<p>When you reach 11 th level, the tower's platform can extend 5 feet by 10 feet and rise up to 40 feet When you reach 17th level, the tower's platform can cover a 10-foot square, and rise up to 50 feet.

The wall includes a ladder on the side of your choice. You choose whether the wall contains any openings otherwise. Any openings chosen in this way can be seen through on both sides. The wall can be climbed, but requires a Strength (Athletics) check against your tech save DC for any creature without a climbing speed. A creature can only make this check once per turn.</p>\n<p>When you reach 11 th level, the wall can deploy up to 45 feet long and 15 feet high, or a ringed wall up to 15 feet in diameter and 15 feet high. Additionally, the wall now provides half cover to any creature on its ramparts. When you reach 17th level, the wall can deploy up to 60 feet long and 20 feet high, or a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter and 20 feet high. Additionally, the wall now provides three-quarters cover to any creature on its ramparts.</p>\n<h2>Potent Fortifications</h2>\n<p><em><strong>Construction Engineering:</strong> 3rd level</em></p>\n<p>When a friendly creature other than you that you can see is hit with a ranged attack while within 5 feet of your deployed portable structure, you can use your reaction and expend one use of your Potent Aptitude to have your structure take the damage instead. If your structure would normally have immunity or resistance to this damage, it loses that immunity or resistance for this attack. When you do so, the damage is reduced by an amount equal to 1 d10 + your Intelligence modifier + your engineer level.</p>\n<h2>Build and Destroy</h2>\n<p><em><strong>Construction Engineering:</strong> 6th level</em></p>\n<p>You've learned how to manipulate the weak points in structures with your technology.

Over the course of a long rest, you can expend 500 cr worth of materials to create your modified biochemist's pack. You must have a biochemist's kit, a poisoner's kit, and materials in order to perform this modification.</p>\n<p>Your biochemist's pack is enhanced, requires attunement, can only be used by you, and counts as a tech focus for your tech powers while you are attuned to it. Your modified biochemist's pack has 4 modification slots, and it gains more at higher levels, as shown in the Modification Slots column of the engineer class table. For each modification installed, your tech point maximum is reduced by 1. Over the course of a long rest, you can replace or remove a number of modifications up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one).</p>\n<p>Some modification effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your tech save DC.</p>\n<p>Your modified biochemist's pack comes equipped with a chemical distribution system, complete with three chemical mixtures: corrosive, invigorating, and noxious. As an action, you can activate your distributor and target a creature within 30 feet, with an effect determined by the mixture.</p>\n<h3>Corrosive Mixture</h3>\n<p>Your distributor emits a burst of acid. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 1d6 + your Intelligence modifier acid damage. This mixture's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).</p>\n<h3>Invigorating Mixture</h3>\n<p>Your distributor emits a bolt of kolto. The target gains 1d6 + your Intelligence modifier temporary hit points, which last until the end of your next turn. The temporary hit points granted by this mixture increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).</p>\n<h3>Noxious Mixture</h3>\n<p>Your distributor emits a cloud of poison. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 1d6 + your Intelligence modifier poison damage. This mixture's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).</p>\n<h2>Biochemist's Touch</h2>\n<p>Lastly at 3rd level, whenever you grant temporary hit points, or deal acid or poison damage using a tech power or class feature, you may expend one use of your Potent Aptitude to increase the potency. When you do so, the amount of temporary hit points you grant or damage you deal is increased by the amount rolled on the die. The damage is the same type as the original damage.</p>\n<h2>Potent Mixtures</h2>\n<p>Beginning at 6th level, when you cast a tech power of 1st-level or higher that grants temporary hit points, or deals acid or poison damage, you add your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of +1) to the roll.</p>\n<h2>Epicenter</h2>\n<p>At 14th level, as a reaction when you take damage from a creature within 15 feet of you that you can see, you can use one of your mixtures. The effects of the mixture release in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on you, and if the mixture requires a saving throw, you automatically succeed on it. Additionally, the affected area is difficult terrain to creatures other than you until the end of your next turn.</p>\n<p>Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p>\n<h2>Masterful Mixtures</h2>\n<p>Starting at 18th level, when you deal acid or poison damage using a tech power or class feature, you ignore resistance and treat immunity as resistance.</p>\n<h2>Biochem Modifications</h2>\n<p>If a modification has prerequisites, you must meet them to install it. You can install the modification at the same time that you meet its prerequisites.</p>\n<h3>Biochemist's Amplifer</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 5th level</em> <br />You gain a +1 bonus to tech attack rolls. This bonus increases to +2 at 11th level and +3 at 17th level.</p>\n<h3>Biochemist's Inhibitor</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 5th level</em> <br />You gain a +1 bonus to your tech save DC. This bonus increases to +2 at 11th level and +3 at 17th level.</p>\n<h3>Chemical Counteragents</h3>\n<p>You may choose one type of damage that benefits from your Biochemist's Touch and Potent Mixtures features. While wearing your modified biochemist's pack you have resistance to that type of damage.</p>\n<p>You can select this modification multiple times. Each time you do so, you must choose a different damage type.</p>\n<h3>Countertoxin</h3>\n<p>When you or an ally within 30 feet of you is suffering from the poisoned condition, you may use your reaction on your turn to end the poisoned condition on that creature. The creature also gains immunity to the poisoned condition for one minute.</p>\n<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest.</p>\n<h3>Detachable Distribution System</h3>\n<p>You upgrade your distributor with a secondary, detachable distributor. As a bonus action, you can throw your detachable distributor at a point within range. Your detachable distributor has a range equal to 30 feet + your Strength modifier x 5. Your detachable distributor works for 1 minute before coming inert. Once it does so, you can't use it again until you recover it as an action.</p>\n<p>Additionally, while your detachable distributor is within 100 feet of you, when you use your action to activate your distributor, you can choose to affect each creature within 5 feet of your detachable distributor. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest.</p>\n<h3>Drone Distribution System</h3>\n<p>You upgrade your distributor, interfacing it with the target of your @Compendium[sw5e.techpowers.PopHJSVZq9t1FFf5]{Tracker Droid Interface}&nbsp;power. When you use your action to activate your distributor, while your tracker droid is within 100 feet of you, you can choose to have your tracker droid deliver the mixture. Your tracker droid must use its reaction to deliver the mixture.</p>\n<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest.</p>\n<h3>Expanded Chemicals: Combustibles</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 5th level</em> <br />You add additional chemicals to your modified biochemist's pack. When you deal fire damage with a tech power or class feature, you can use your Biochemist's Touch and Potent Mixture features.</p>\n<p>Additionally, when a creature fails their Dexterity saving throw against your Corrosive Mixtures feature, you can choose to instead deal fire damage. If you do so, each creature within 5 feet of the target takes fire damage equal to your Intelligence modifier. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest.</p>\n<h3>Expanded Chemicals: Cryogenics</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 5th level</em> <br />You add additional chemicals to your modified biochemist's pack. When you deal cold damage with a tech power or class feature, you can use your Biochemist's Touch and Potent Mixture features.</p>\n<p>Additionally, when a creature fails their Constitution saving throw against your Noxious Mixtures feature, you can choose to instead deal cold damage. If you do so, its speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest.</p>\n<h3>Expanded Chemicals: Restorative</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 5th level</em> <br />You add additional chemicals to your modified biochemist's pack. When you restore hit points with a tech power or class feature, you can use your Biochemist's Touch and Potent Mixture features.</p>\n<p>Additionally, when you use your Invigorating Mixture to grant temporary hit points to a creature, you can choose to restore that many hit points to the same creature. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest.</p>\n<h3>Expanded Mixtures: Adhesive</h3>\n<p>You've created a new mixture from your chemicals that you can use when you activate your distributor. When you do so, the target creature must make a Strength saving throw. If the creature is Large or larger, it has advantage on the saving throw. On a failed save, a creature's speed is reduced to 0 until the start of your next turn. As an action on their turn, an affected creature can repeat this saving throw, ending the effect on a success.</p>\n<h3>Expanded Mixtures: Blinding</h3>\n<p>You've created a new mixture from your chemicals that you can use when you activate your distributor. When you do so, the target creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is blinded until the start of your next turn.</p>\n<h3>Expanded Mixtures: Hallucinogenic</h3>\n<p>You've created a new mixture from your chemicals that you can use when you activate your distributor. When you do so, the target creature must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target loses the ability to distinguish friend from foe, regarding all creatures it can see as enemies until the end of your next turn. Each time the target takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p>\n<p>Whenever the affected creature chooses another creature as a target, it must choose the target at random from among the creatures it can see within range of the attack, power, or other ability it's using. If an enemy provokes an opportunity attack from the affected creature, the creature must make that attack if it is able to.</p>\n<p>This feature has no effect on droids or constructs.</p>\n<h3>Explosive Distribution System</h3>\n<p>You upgrade your distributor, granting it the ability to create a volley.

You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest.</p>\n<h3>Injection Apparatus</h3>\n<p>You install a wrist mounted injection apparatus into your modified biochemist's pack. It is a simple vibroweapon with the finesse and light properties, and deals 1d4 kinetic damage on a hit. Your injection apparatus does not fill the hand slot, but you can't use it while the hand is full.</p>\n<p>When you hit with the weapon, you can activate your distributor to deploy one of your mixtures. If you do so, the target has disadvantage on the saving throw against your mixture.</p>\n<h3>Inoculation</h3>\n<p>You gain immunity to the poisoned and diseased conditions.</p>\n<h3>Integrated EVA Functionality</h3>\n<p>You make several additions to your modified biochemist's pack, you are protected from hazardous conditions, as if wearing an EVA suit, for as long as you are wearing your modified biochemist's pack.</p>\n<h3>Kolto Aerosol</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 9th level</em> <br />You add a special dispersal system to your modified biochemist's pack. This system slowly disperses small amounts of kolto in the air. If creatures spend the entirety of a long rest within 30 feet of you, they regain all expended Hit Dice, instead of only half. Additionally, they are cured of any poisons or diseases that are suffering from.</p>\n<h3>Long-Range Distribution System</h3>\n<p>You upgrade your distributor, improving the range. When you use your action to activate your distributor, you can choose to increase the range to 60 feet.</p>\n<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once).

As an action, you can coat an item, object, or location up to 5-foot-square with this gel. When you do so, the gel sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The gel lasts for 1 hour before losing its potency. You can end this effect as a bonus action.</p>\n<h3>Oil Spill</h3>\n<p>As an action, you can cast the <em>oil slick</em> tech power without expending tech points. Casting the power in this way does not require concentration, and the oil will remain in place for the full duration of the power.</p>\n<p>Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p>\n<h3>Persistent Chemicals</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 7th level</em> <br />Whenever you use your Biochemist's Touch feature, you may select one creature that was damaged. At the start of each of that creature's turns, it must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes damage of the triggering type equal to your Intelligence modifier and has disadvantage on attack rolls until the start of its next turn. On a success, this feature ends, and the creature becomes immune to it for one day.</p>\n<p>Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p>\n<h3>Piercing Gel</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 11th level</em> <br /><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Luminous Gel</em> <br />Your luminous gel now automatically dispels illusions and can detect invisibility, as with truesight.</p>\n<h3>Self-Injection Module</h3>\n<p>You install a special kolto injector into your modified biochemist's pack that can inject you with kolto in response to pain.

Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be charmed by you. While charmed in this way, the target idolizes you, speaking glowingly of you to anyone who talks to it. Additionally, it hinders anyone who opposes you, although it avoids violence unless it was already inclined to fight on your behalf.

For the duration, whenever any creature tries to attack you for the first time on a turn, the attacker must make a Charisma saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier). On a failed save, it can't attack you on this turn, and it must choose a new target for its attack or the attack is wasted. On a successful save, it can attack you on this turn, but it has disadvantage on any saving throw it makes against your powers on your next turn.</p>\n<p>Once you've used this feature, you must com-plete a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p>"},"source":"PHB","activation":{"cost":null,"type":""},"actionType":"","damage":{"parts":[]},"armorproperties":{"parts":[]},"weaponproperties":{"parts":[]},"classCasterType":"Forcecaster"},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false}},"img":"systems/sw5e/packs/Icons/Archetypes/Beguiler%20Practice.webp","effects":[]}

The maneuvers are listed in alphabetical order.</p>\n<h3>Agonizing Lethargy</h3>\n<p>You can use an action to expend a superiority die. When you do so, choose a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 1d6 necrotic damage for each attack it makes until the start of your next turn. A creature targeted by your Critical Analysis has disadvantage on the save.</p>\n<h3>Befogging Ichor</h3>\n<p>You can use a bonus action to expend a superiority die.

If the direction rolled is blocked, the target doesn't move.</p>\n<h3>Chains of Transfixing</h3>\n<p>You can use a bonus action to expend a superiority die.

The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, add the result to the damage roll, and you regain one expended Hit Die.</p>\n<h3>Deathseek</h3>\n<p>When an attack made against the target of your Critical Analysis that you can see would miss, you can use a reaction to expend a superiority die and roll it to force the creature to instead take the hit. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes the minimum damage the attack could have dealt plus additional damage equal to the roll.</p>\n<h3>Reverse Curse</h3>\n<p>When another creature attempts to charm or frighten you or an ally you can see within 15 feet of you, you can use your reaction to expend a superiority die and roll it to attempt to turn the effect back on that creature. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be be charmed or frightened by you, dependent on the triggering ability, for a number of rounds equal to the die roll or until the creature takes any damage.</p>\n<h3>Shadow Puppetry</h3>\n<p>When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is reduced to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to expend a superiority die to give that creature a final act of aggression. That creature can immediately move a number of feet equal to 5 times the result of the die and make a single weapon attack against a target of your choice within its attack range, adding the die to the attack roll.</p>\n<h3>Water of Life</h3>\n<p>When an allied creature within 30 feet that you can see takes damage, you can use a reaction to expend a superiority die and roll it. The ally regains a number of hit points equal to the roll + your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<h3>Wracking Torment</h3>\n<p>When a hostile creature you can see within 30 feet would take damage from an effect you or a friendly creature controls, you can use your reaction to expend a superiority die to temporarily weaken their resilience against it. Until the end of the turn, the target loses resistance to the damage types of the triggering attack or power.</p>\n<h2>Heightened Hex</h2>\n<p><em><strong>Occultist Pursuit:</strong> 6th level</em></p>\n<p>When you use your Curse of Objurgation feature, each time the cursed creature deals damage to you or an allied creature you can see within 5 feet of you, the creature takes psychic damage equal to twice your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 2).</p>\n<h2>Voodoo Doll</h2>\n<p><em><strong>Occultist Pursuit:</strong> 9th level</em></p>\n<p>Over the course of an hour, which can be done during a short rest, you can perform a ritual to construct an effigy of a creature. In order to do so, you must have at least heard of or seen the creature before, and the target must be in the same system as you. At the end of the hour, the creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your maneuver save DC. This saving throw is modified by how well you know the target and the sort of physical connection you have to it, as shown in the Knowledge Save Modifier and Connection Save Modifier tables below.</p>\n<h3 style=\"color: #000000; text-transform: none;\">Knowledge Save Modifier</h3>\n<table style=\"border: 0; width: 300px;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Secondhand (you have heard of the target)</td>\n<td align=\"right\">+5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>firsthand (you have met the target</td>\n<td align=\"right\">+0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Familiar (you know the target well)</td>\n<td align=\"right\">-5</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3 style=\"color: #000000; text-transform: none;\">Connection Save Modifier</h3>\n<table style=\"border: 0; width: 300px;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Likeness or picture</td>\n<td align=\"right\">-2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Curse of Objurgation</td>\n<td align=\"right\">-3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Possession or garment</td>\n<td align=\"right\">-4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Body part, lock of hair, bit of nail, or the like</td>\n<td align=\"right\">-10</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>On a successful save, the target isn't affected, and you can't use this ritual against it again for 24 hours. On a failed save, the ritual creates a Tiny doll that is linked to the target. The doll remains linked for 24 hours, or for 10 minutes after you first use it. It disintegrates at the end of this duration. For the duration, you can see and hear the target through the doll as if you were within 5 feet of the creature.</p>\n<p>Additionally, as action while the doll is in your possession, you can expend a Hit Die to torment the target, choosing an effect from the following options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Burn:</strong> The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target believes it is burning. While burning in this way, the target has has disadvantage on attack rolls made with Strength or Dexterity. This effect lasts for 1 hour.</li>\n<li><strong>Pain:</strong> The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be wracked with pain for 1 hour. While in pain in this way, the target takes an additional 1d4 psychic damage whenever it takes damage.</li>\n<li><strong>Stab:</strong> The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or gain 2 slowed levels and fall prone. The slowed levels effect lasts for 1 hour.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The target can only be under 1 effect at a time. When you use a new effect, any existing effects end.

When the target of your Curse of Objurgation fails a saving throw against one of your maneuvers, you can choose to amplify that maneuver by expending a number of Hit Dice of your choice. The target immediately takes 1d8 psychic damage for every Hit Die spent in this way.</p>\n<p>Additionally, when creatures attempt to use a power like <em>remove curse</em> or other similar abilities to remove a curse you set, they must roll a Wisdom or Charisma check (their choice) against your maneuver save DC. On a failed save, their attempt fails, and any force or tech points spent in this way are wasted.</p>\n<h2>Occultist Discoveries</h2>\n<p>When you select this pursuit, you gain access to new discoveries which reflect your research on the occult. Whenever you learn a new discovery, you can choose from any of the following as well. The discoveries are listed in alphabetical order.</p>\n<h3>Arcane Membrane</h3>\n<p>You can add half your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, rounded up, minimum of+1) to any Intelligence (Lore) or Intelligence (Nature) checks you make.</p>\n<h3>Evil Eye</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 5th level</em></p>\n<p>You can cast the <em>bestow curse</em> and <em>remove curse</em> force powers without spending force points. Wisdom or Charisma (your choice) is your forcecasting modifier for these powers.</p>\n<p>Once you've cast a power using this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can cast it again.</p>\n<h3>Exsanguination</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 9th level</em></p>\n<p>When a creature marked by your Curse of Objurgation is reduced to 0 hit points, you can use a reaction and expend a Hit Die to immediately regain a use of your Curse of Objurgation.</p>\n<h3>Hexes and Superstitions</h3>\n<p>When you roll a 13 on an ability check, you treat it as if you rolled a 20.</p>\n<h3>Natural Karma</h3>\n<p>Before you use a maneuver or power to set a curse on a target you can see, you can make a contested Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check against the target's Wisdom (Insight) check. On a success, the target is unaware you set the curse on them.</p>\n<h3>Savage Sortilege</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 13th level</em></p>\n<p>You ignore resistance to psychic damage, and you have resistance to psychic damage.</p>\n<h3>Supernatural Vigor</h3>\n<p>At the end of a long rest, you can choose one creature you can see within 30 feet (this includes you) to imbue with unnatural power.
