You gain the following benefits while wielding any of these weapons, if you are proficient with it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You gain a +1 bonus to the weapon's attack rolls.</li>\n<li>Whenever you have advantage on an attack roll and hit and the lower of the two [[/r d20]] rolls would also hit (or a creature has disadvantage on a saving throw and the higher of the two d20s would also fail), and the target is no more than one size larger than you (your size or smaller if your weapon has the light property), you have advantage on the weapon's damage roll.</li>\n<li>Your ranged weapon attacks reduce partial cover by one step (from three-quarters to half or half to one-quarter) against targets within 30 feet of you. If the target has one-quarter cover, you ignore it entirely.</li>\n<li>When you take the Attack action, you can choose to forgo one or more attacks to  <strong>scramble</strong>. For each attack you forgo, you can move up to 10 feet without provoking opportunity attacks. If you could already scramble, instead you can do so as your bonus action.</li></ul>",
