Make an Intelligence (Investigation) check contested by the target's Charisma (Deception) check. If your check succeeds, if a friendly creature makes an attack roll against the target and they can see and hear you, you can use your reaction to grant them advantage on the roll. If you do so, and they hit, they deal additional damage equal to your bonus to Investigation checks. This damage is the same type as the attack's damage. If your check fails, you can't use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Intuit (Insight).</em></strong> You attempt to determine the motivations of one humanoid you can see within 30 feet.

Make a Wisdom (Survival) check contested by the target's Wisdom (Perception) check. If your check succeeds, and the target moves towards you before the start of your next turn, it gains 1 slowed level, and you can use your reaction to cause it to fall prone.

Make an Intelligence (Piloting) check contested by the target's Intelligence (Piloting) check. If your check succeeds, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls against you, and you have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against the target, until the start of your next turn. If your check fails, the target instead has advantage on attack rolls against you, and you have disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws against the target, until the start of your next turn.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Study (Lore).</em></strong> You attempt to anticipate your target's action. Make an Intelligence (Lore) check contested by the target's Charisma (Deception) check. If your check succeeds, you have advantage on the first ability check, attack roll or saving throw you make against that creature before the end of your next turn. Alternatively, before the end of your next turn, you can use your reaction to grant disadvantage on the first ability check, attack roll, or saving throw the target makes against you. If your check fails, you instead have disadvantage on the first ability check, attack roll or saving throw you make against that creature before the end of your next turn.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Wrestle (Athletics).</em></strong> You attempt to grab and pin a creature within 5 feet of you with at least one free hand. The target must be no more than one size larger than you. Make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use).
