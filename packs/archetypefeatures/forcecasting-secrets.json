Choose two force powers of 1st level. The chosen powers count as tech powers for you, but are not included in the number in the Powers Known column of the engineer table.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you learn two additional force powers of 1st or 2nd level. At 13th level, you learn two force powers of 1st-3rd level, and at 17th level, you learn two force powers of 1st-4th level. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the force powers you know and replace it with another force power of the same level.</p>",
