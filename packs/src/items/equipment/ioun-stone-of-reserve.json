      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, (requires attunement)</em></p>\n<p>An Ioun Stone is named after Ioun, a god of knowledge and prophecy revered on some worlds. Many types of Ioun stone exist, each type a distinct combination of shape and color.</p>\n<p>When you use an action to toss one of these stones into the air, the stone orbits your head at a distance of 1d3 feet and confers a benefit to you. Thereafter, another creature must use an action to grasp or net the stone to separate it from you, either by making a successful attack roll against AC 24 or a successful DC 24 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. You can use an action to seize and stow the stone, ending its effect.</p>\n<p>A stone has AC 24, 10 hit points, and resistance to all damage. It is considered to be an object that is being worn while it orbits your head.</p>\n<p><strong>Stone of Reserve</strong>. This vibrant purple prism stores powers cast into it, holding them until you use them. The stone can store up to 3 levels worth of powers at a time. When found, it contains 1d4 − 1 levels of stored powers chosen by the GM.</p>\n<p>Any creature can cast a power of 1st through 3rd level into the stone by touching it as the power is cast. The power has no effect, other than to be stored in the stone. If the stone can't hold the power, the power is expended without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the power determines how much space it uses.</p>\n<p>While this stone orbits your head, you can cast any power stored in it. The power uses the slot level, power save DC, power attack bonus, and powercasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the power. The power cast from the stone is no longer stored in it, freeing up space.</p>",
