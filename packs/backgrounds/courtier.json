You might have been one of the behind-the-scenes law-keepers or functionaries on Dromund Kaas, or you might have grown up on some other affluent planet.</p>\n<p>Even if you are no longer a full-fledged member of the group that gave you your start in life, your relationships with your former fellows can be an advantage for you and your adventuring comrades.
