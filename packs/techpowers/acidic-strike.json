      "value": "<p>As part of the action used to cast this power, you must make a melee weapon attack against one creature within your reach, otherwise the power fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects, and it becomes sheathed in a thick acidic slime until the start of your next turn. Until the start of your next turn, if the target becomes grappled, or succeeds in grappling or maintaining a grapple, the slime is pressed into its body, causing it to immediately take [[/r 1d8]] acid damage. </p>\n<p>This power's damage increases when you reach higher levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra [[/r 1d8]] acid damage to the target, and the damage the target takes for taking grappling or maintaining a grapple increases to [[/r 2d8]]. Both damage rolls increase by [[/r 1d8]] at 11th level and 17th level.</p>",
