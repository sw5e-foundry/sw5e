This kind of flashy combat is your entertainer routine, though you might also have some skills as a tumbler or actor. Using your A Champion Well Known feature, you can find a place to perform in any place that features combat for entertainment—perhaps a gladiatorial arena or secret pit fighting club. </p>\n\t<p></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"background\">\n\t<p><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> Choose two from Acrobatics, Athletics, Intimidation, and Performance</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"background\">\n\t<p><strong>Tool Proficiencies:</strong> One type of musical instrument</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"background\">\n\t<p><strong>Languages:</strong> One of your choice</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"background\">\n\t<p><strong>Equipment:</strong> A trophy earned via some sort of competition, clothing suitable to your profession, and a belt pouch containing 150 cr</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"background\"><h2>Feature: A Champion Well Known</h2></div>\n<div class=\"background\"><p>You can always find a place to perform, usually in an inn or tavern but possibly with a circus, at a theater, or even in a noble's court. At such a place, you receive free lodging and food of a modest or comfortable standard (depending on the quality of the establishment), as long as you perform each night. In addition, your performance makes you something of a local figure. When strangers recognize you in a town where you have performed, they typically take a liking to you.\n</p></div><h2>Background Feat</h2>\n<p>\n\tAs a further embodiment of the experience and training of your background, you can choose from the\n\tfollowing feats:\n</p>\n<div class=\"smalltable\">\n\t<p>\n\t\t</p><table><thead><tr><th>[[/r d8 # Feat]]</th><th>Feat</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class=\"rows\"><th>1</th><th>@Compendium[sw5e.feats.tRBTUPCE7z2NXh6t]{Acrobat}</th></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><th>2</th><th>@Compendium[sw5e.feats.qSXmQGXxdYTfY7JP]{Brawny}</th></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><th>3</th><th>@Compendium[sw5e.feats.fY1YANOeKzcwN5Kh]{Threatening}</th></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><th>4</th><th>@Compendium[sw5e.feats.17gBRGzWPRJiQvTs]{Performer}</th></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><th>5</th><th>@Compendium[sw5e.feats.f7d2Ishti7Ui7zdq]{Entertainer}</th></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><th>6</th><th>@Compendium[sw5e.feats.bqcghDqZHiXg1VqF]{Linguist}</th></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><th>7</th><th>@Compendium[sw5e.feats.wKpnpjOfwA7sF4WP]{Athlete}</th></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><th>8</th><th>@Compendium[sw5e.feats.80x5pu3OUqn60QKC]{Durable}</th></tr></tbody></table>\n\t<p></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"background\"><h2>Suggested Characteristics</h2></div>\n<div class=\"medtable\">\n\t<p>\n\t\t</p><table><thead><tr><th>[[/r d8 # Personality Trait]]</th><th>Personality Trait</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class=\"rows\"><th>1</th><th>I know a story relevant to almost every situation.</th></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><th>2</th><th>Whenever I come to a new place, I collect local rumors and spread gossip.</th></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><th>3</th><th>I'm a hopeless romantic, always searching for that —special someone.—</th></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><th>4</th><th>Nobody stays angry at me or around me for long, since I can defuse any amount of tension.</th></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><th>5</th><th>I love a good insult, even one directed at me.</th></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><th>6</th><th>I get bitter if I'm not the center of attention.</th></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><th>7</th><th>I'll settle for nothing less than perfection.</th></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><th>8</th><th>I change my mood or my mind as quickly as I change key in a song.</th></tr></tbody></table>\n\t<p></p>\n</div>\n<p> </p><div class=\"medtable\">\n\t<p>\n\t\t</p><table><thead><tr><th>[[/r d6 # Ideal]]</th><th>Ideal</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class=\"rows\"><th>1</th><th>Beauty: When I perform, I make the world better than it was.
