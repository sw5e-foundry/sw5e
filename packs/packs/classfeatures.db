{"_id":"047L6iPjOrgNEZ5L","name":"Focused Superiority","permission":{"default":0,"lwoKvFakziGOHjXS":3},"type":"classfeature","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>When you choose this technique at 3rd level, you learn maneuvers that are fueled by special dice called superiority dice.</p>\n<h4><strong>MANEUVERS</strong></h4>\n<p>You know two maneuvers of your choice, which are detailed under &ldquo;Maneuvers&rdquo; below, and you earn more at higher levels, as shown in the Maneuvers Known column of the Deadeye Technique Focused Superiority table. Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one maneuver per attack, and you may only use each maneuver once per turn.</p>\n<p>Each time you learn new maneuvers, you can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one.</p>\n<h4><strong>SUPERIORITY DICE</strong></h4>\n<p>You have two superiority dice, which are d4s, and you earn more at higher levels, as shown in the Superiority Dice column of the Deadeye Technique Focused Superiority table. This die changes as you gain scout levels, as shown in the Focused Superiority column of the Deadeye Technique Focused Superiority table. A superiority die is expended when you use it.</p>\n<p>You regain all of your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<h4><strong>SAVING THROWS</strong></h4>\n<p>Some of your maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver&rsquo;s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Maneuver save DC</strong>&nbsp;= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice)</p>\n<hr />\n<h1>MANEUVERS</h1>\n<p>The maneuvers are presented in alphabetical order.</p>\n<hr />\n<blockquote>\n<h4><strong>CRIPPLING SHOT</strong></h4>\n<p>When you hit a creature with a ranged weapon attack, you can expend a superiority die to cripple its movement. Add the number rolled to the damage of the ranged weapon attack. The creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or have its movement speed halved. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make a Constitution saving throw to end the effect.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>DARING ESCAPE</strong></h4>\n<p>You can expend one superiority die to take the Disengage action as a bonus action until the end of your turn. Until the end of this turn, you have advantage on all Strength (Athletics) checks.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>COVERING FIRE</strong></h4>\n<p>When you hit a creature with a ranged weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to maneuver one of your comrades into a more advantageous position. You add the superiority die to the attack&rsquo;s damage roll, and you choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you.</p>\n<p>That creature can use its reaction to move up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks from the target of your attack.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>DISARMING SHOT</strong></h4>\n<p>When you hit a creature with a ranged weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to disarm the target, forcing it to drop one item of your choice that it&rsquo;s holding. Add the superiority die to the attack&rsquo;s damage roll, and the target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it drops the object you choose. The object lands at its feet.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>DISTRACTING SHOT</strong></h4>\n<p>When you hit a creature with a ranged weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to distract the creature, giving your allies an opening. You add the superiority die to the attack&rsquo;s damage roll. The next attack roll against the target by an attacker other than you has advantage if the attack is made before the start of your next turn.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>EXPLOIT WEAKNESS</strong></h4>\n<p>When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend a superiority die and deal additional damage equal to the number rolled. This damage cannot be reduced in any way.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>PENETRATING SHOT</strong></h4>\n<p>When you hit a creature with a ranged weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to damage another creature with the same attack. Choose up to two creatures within 15 feet of and directly behind your initial target. If the original attack roll would hit the second creature(s), it takes damage equal to the number you roll on your superiority die.</p>\n<p>The damage is of the same type dealt by the original attack.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>PRECISION ATTACK</strong></h4>\n<p>When you make a weapon attack roll against a creature, you can expend one superiority die to add it to the roll. You can use this maneuver before or after making the attack roll, but before any effects of the attack are applied.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>RETURN FIRE</strong></h4>\n<p>When a creature misses you with a ranged attack, you can use your reaction and expend one superiority die to make a ranged weapon attack against the creature. If you hit, you add the superiority die to the attack&rsquo;s damage roll.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<table class=\"table text-center LevelTable_levelTable_14CWn\" style=\"width: 90%; margin-left: auto;

Whenever you learn a new maneuver, you can choose from any of the following as well. The maneuvers are listed in alphabetical order.</p>\n<hr />\n<blockquote>\n<h4><strong>ADRENALINE HIT</strong></h4>\n<p>You can use an action and expend one superiority die to inject a creature with regenerative medication that temporarily enhances their agility. When you do so, a creature you can touch regains hit points equal to the superiority die roll. Additionally, until the start of your next turn, when that creature would take damage, the amount is reduced by an amount equal to your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>EMERGENCY PRESCRIPTION</strong></h4>\n<p>As an action, you can expend one superiority die and touch a creature. That creature regains hit points equal to result of the die + your Intelligence modifier, and when that creature makes their first ability check, attack roll, or saving throw before the start of your next turn they roll the superiority die and add it to the roll.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>ENHANCEMENT INJECTION</strong></h4>\n<p>As an action, you can expend one superiority die to inject a creature you can touch with enhancements, granting them temporary hit points equal to the superiority die roll + your Intelligence modifier, which last for 1 minute. Additionally, when the target makes a Strength or Constitution check or saving throw while it has these temporary hit points, it gains a bonus equal to your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>NEUROBLOCK</strong></h4>\n<p>When you make an attack roll, you can expend a superiority die and add it to the attack roll. On a hit, the creature&rsquo;s next attack has disadvantage and it cannot regain hit points until the start of your next turn.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>REASSURE</strong></h4>\n<p>As an action, you can expend a superiority die and call out to a creature within 60 feet that can see or hear you that is charmed, frightened, or stunned. When you do so, that creature immediately makes another saving throw, adding the amount rolled to the save.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>REMOVE TOXINS</strong></h4>\n<p>As an action, you can expend a superiority die to purge the toxins from a creature you can touch. The target regains hit points equal to the number rolled and, if it is poisoned or diseased, you neutralize the poison or disease. If more than one poison or disease afflicts the target, you neutralize one poison or disease that you know is present, or you neutralize one at random.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>SMELLING SALTS</strong></h4>\n<p>As a bonus action, you can expend a superiority die to heal a creature you can touch by a number of hit points equal to the number rolled.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>TRANSFUSION</strong></h4>\n<p>Once per turn when you hit a creature with a finesse melee weapon, you can expend a superiority to give you or an ally that is within 5 feet of the creature a transfusion. Add the superiority dice to the damage you deal. You or your ally gain hit points equivalent to the damage you deal to the creature.</p>\n<p>You can be the creature hit with the attack as long as there is an ally with 5 feet of you, in which you can let it hit without rolling an attack and must choose an ally to heal with the transfusion.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>WEAK POINT STRIKE</strong></h4>\n<p>When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend a superiority die to temporarily daze the creature. Add the number rolled to the damage of the weapon attack and the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of its next turn.</p>\n</blockquote>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"PHB","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"power"},"className":""},"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[]}

You gain an additional option at 11th and 17th level.</p>\n<p>You can use these features a combined number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, as shown in the monk table. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.</p>\n<p>While you have no remaining uses of this feature, you can instead expend 2 focus points to use it. When you do so, your maximum focus points are reduced by 2 until you complete a long rest.</p>\n<hr />\n<blockquote>\n<h3><strong>Burning Ember Flourish</strong></h3>\n<p>You can use your action to choose an area of flame that you can see and that fits within a 5-foot cube within 60 feet. You can extinguish the fire in that area, and you create either fireworks or smoke when you do so.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Fireworks.&nbsp;The target explodes with a dazzling display of colors. Each creature within 10 feet of the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become blinded until the end of your next turn.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Smoke.&nbsp;Thick black smoke spreads out from the target in a 20-foot radius, moving around corners. The area of the smoke is heavily obscured. The smoke persists for 1 minute or until a strong wind disperses it.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Curtain of Unyielding Wind</strong></h3>\n<p>As an action, you can spend 2 focus points to call up a mighty gale, which swirls around you in a 10-foot radius and moves with you, remaining centered on you. The wind lasts for 10 minutes. The wind deafens both you and other creatures in its area. It extinguishes unprotected flames in its area that are torch-sized or smaller and hedges out vapor, gas, and fog that can be dispersed by strong wind. The area is difficult terrain for creatures other than you, and the attack rolls of ranged weapon attacks have disadvantage if the attacks pass in or out of the wind.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Crushing Hand of the Mountain</strong></h3>\n<p>As an action, you can choose a 5-foot-square unoccupied space on the ground that you can see within 30 feet. A Medium hand made from soil and stone, which lasts for 1 minute, rises in that space and reaches for one Large or smaller creature you can see within 5 feet of it. The target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 2d6 kinetic damage and is restrained for the duration. As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can cause the hand to crush the restrained target, which must make a Strength saving throw. It takes 2d6 kinetic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. To break out, the restrained creature can use its action to make a Strength check against your focus save DC. On a success, the target escapes and is no longer restrained by the hand. As an action, you can cause the hand to reach for a different creature or to move to a different unoccupied space within range. The hand releases a restrained target if you do either.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Hatchling's Flame</strong></h3>\n<p>As an action, you focus your energy into a torrent of fire that streaks away from you. A line of roaring flame 30 feet long and 5 feet wide emanates from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Patient Bantha Listens</strong></h3>\n<p>You reach out to the ground beneath you. You can use your bonus action to gain tremorsense with a range of 30 feet and a burrow speed equal to your walking speed for up to 1 minute. Your movement leaves behind a tunnel that remains for as long as this ability is active, after which it collapses.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Rush of the Shyrack</strong></h3>\n<p>As an action, you can spend 2 focus points to form a line of strong wind 60 feet long and 10 feet wide that blasts from you in a direction you choose for one minute or until you lose concentration or dismiss the effect (no action required). Each Large or smaller creature that starts its turn in the line must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet away from you in a direction following the line. Any creature in the line must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves when moving closer to you. The gust disperses gas or vapor, and it extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames in the area. It causes protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly and has a 50 percent chance to extinguish them. As a bonus action on each of your turns before the effect ends, you can change the direction in which the line blasts from you.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Shape the Raincloud</strong></h3>\n<p>You can use your action to pull water from air and return it to the atmosphere. In an open container, you can create up to 20 gallons of drinkable water. You may also produce a rain that falls within a 30-foot cube and extinguishes open-air flames. You can destroy the same amount of water in an open container, or destroy a 30-foot cube of fog.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Swarming Ice Rabbit</strong></h3>\n<p>As an action, you can cause a flurry of ice crystals to erupt from a point you can see within 90 feet. Each creature in a 5-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d6 cold damage and gains 1 slowed level until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't slowed.</p>\n</blockquote>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"EC","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"power"},"className":"","requirements":""},"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[]}

As a bonus action on your droid&rsquo;s turn, your droid can analyze a target it can see within 60 feet of it. For the next minute, or until it analyzes another target, it gains the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When it analyzes a hostile creature, its attack and damage rolls made with weapons with the finesse property or blaster weapons against that target may use its Intelligence modifier instead of Strength or Dexterity.</li>\n<li>When it analyzes a friendly creature, the target can end your droid&rsquo;s Analysis Protocol on them (no action required) to add half your droid&rsquo;s Intelligence modifier (rounded down, minimum of +1) to one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw. Once a friendly creature has benefited from this ability, they can not do so again until they complete a short or long rest.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>ARM CANNONS</strong></h4>\n<p>You install dual arm cannons in your droid. The arm cannons have 2 charges. As an action, your droid can use charges to cast the&nbsp;overload&nbsp;tech power, using 1 charge per level. The saving throw is made against your droid&rsquo;s tech save DC (8 + your droid&rsquo;s proficiency bonus + your droid&rsquo;s Intelligence modifier).</p>\n<p>You can choose this modification multiple times. Each time you do so, the arm cannons gain another charge, to a maximum of 4. The arm cannons regain all charges after a long rest.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>BACK-UP PROTOCOL</strong></h4>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;7th level</em><br />You install an emergency protocol in your droid, prompting a quick reboot after critical damage is taken. If your droid would be reduced to 0 hit points, it instead is reduced to 1.</p>\n<p>Once your droid uses this feature, it must finish a short or long rest before it can use it again.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>CELERITY AUGMENT</strong></h4>\n<p>You augment your droid to move a little faster.

When your droid&rsquo;s back-up protocol is initiated, it can use its reaction to make one attack roll against a target within range. If the target is the source of the damage that reduced your droid to 0, the attack roll has advantage.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>ENERGY SHIELD</strong></h4>\n<p>You install an energy shield in your droid, which has 1 charge. As an action, your droid can use 1 charge to cast the&nbsp;energy shield&nbsp;tech power.</p>\n<p>You can choose this modification multiple times.

The saving throw is made against your droid&rsquo;s tech save DC (8 + your droid&rsquo;s proficiency bonus + your droid&rsquo;s Intelligence modifier).</p>\n<p>You can choose this modification multiple times. Each time you do so, the flamethrower gains another charge, to a maximum of 3. If the flamethrower has multiple charges, you can use multiple charges to cast&nbsp;flame sweep&nbsp;at a higher level, 1 point per charge. The flamethrower regains all expended charges after a long rest.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>FOUR-ARMED COMBATANT</strong></h4>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;Class IV Droid</em><br />You install two additional arms to improve your droid&rsquo;s combat capabilities, granting it four arms which it can use independently of one another.

At the start of each of its turns, a creature that consumes this food must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it subtracts half the result of your superiority die (rounded down, minimum of one) from the first ability check, attack roll, or saving throws it makes before the start of its next turn. The effect of this maneuver ends when the creature completes its next long rest or 24 hours have passed. This maneuver has no effect on droids or constructs.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>BRAIN FOOD</strong></h4>\n<p>At the end of a short or long rest you may expend a superiority die and choose a number of friendly creatures up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one), if they ate food you prepared. Each creature gains a number of temporary force or tech points (their choice) equal to the number you roll on the superiority die. When an affected creature casts a force or tech power, the temporary force or tech points are spent first. An affected target can only benefit from one source of temporary force or tech points at a time, and they last until they&rsquo;re depleted or until the affected target completes their next short or long rest. This maneuver has no effect on droids or constructs.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>DEBILITANTS</strong></h4>\n<p>As a bonus action when preparing or touching food, you may expend a superiority die and add to it a subtle poison. Any creature that consumes this food must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, their hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to twice the number rolled on your superiority die + your Intelligence modifier. The effect of this maneuver ends when the creature completes its next long rest or 24 hours have passed. This maneuver has no effect on droids or constructs.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>ENERGIZERS</strong></h4>\n<p>At the end of a short or long rest you may expend a superiority die and choose a number of friendly creatures up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one), if they ate food you prepared. Each creature has their walking speed increased by 10 until the end of their next short or long rest. This maneuver has no effect on droids or constructs.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>ENHANCERS</strong></h4>\n<p>At the end of a short or long rest you may expend a superiority die and choose a number of friendly creatures up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one), if they ate food you prepared. Once before the end of their next short or long rest, affected targets may add the result of the superiority die to a damage roll that would affect only one target. This maneuver has no effect on droids or constructs.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>HEALTH FOOD</strong></h4>\n<p>At the end of a short or long rest you may expend a superiority die and choose a number of friendly creatures up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one), if they ate food you prepared. Each creature gains a number of temporary hit points equal to twice the number you roll on the superiority die. This maneuver has no effect on droids or constructs.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>MUSCLE RELAXANTS</strong></h4>\n<p>As a bonus action while preparing or touching food, you may expend a superiority die and add to it a fast acting muscle relaxant. At the start of each of its turns, a creature that consumes this food must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it subtracts the result of your superiority die from the first damage roll it makes before the start of its next turn. The effect of this maneuver ends when the creature completes its next long rest or 24 hours have passed. This maneuver has no effect on droids or constructs.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>SUPPLEMENTS</strong></h4>\n<p>At the end of a short or long rest you may expend a superiority die and choose a number of friendly creatures up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one), if they ate food you prepared. Once before the end of their next short or long rest, affected targets may add the result of the superiority die to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use this feature, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. This maneuver has no effect on droids or constructs.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>VITAMINS</strong></h4>\n<p>At the end of a short or long rest you may expend a superiority die and choose a number of friendly creatures up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one), if they ate food you prepared. Each creature gains proficiency in Constitution saving throws until the end of their next short or long rest. If a creature was already proficient in Constitution saving throws, they instead become proficient in a saving throw of your choice.

This attack can target a surface, object, or creature.</p>\n<p>A creature struck by this attack is impaled by the hook. As an action, a creature can attempt to remove the hook. Removing the hook requires a Strength check. While the hook is stuck in the target, you are connected to the target by a 60 foot cable.</p>\n<p>While the hook is deployed, you can use your bonus action to activate the reel, pulling yourself to the location if the target is your size or larger. A creature or object smaller than you is pulled to you. Alternatively, you can opt to release the cable (no action required).</p>\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve used this feature, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you recover and reinsert the hook as an action.</p>\n</blockquote>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"PHB","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"power"},"className":""},"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[]}

You can install the modification at the same time that you meet its prerequisites.</p>\n<blockquote><hr />\n<h4><strong>ABSORPTION SHIELD</strong></h4>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;Physical Shield</em><br />You modify your physical shield to block incoming damage. As a bonus action you can activate this ability and gain temporary hit points equal to 1d4 + Intelligence modifier, which last for one hour.</p>\n<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>ACCELERATED MOVEMENT</strong></h4>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;Armor</em><br />You reduce the weight of your modified armor&rsquo;s bulk and increase the power to joints. If the armor has a Strength requirement, you ignore it. The modified armor&rsquo;s weight is reduced by 15 lbs. While wearing your modified armor your speed increases by 10 feet. This applies to all movement speeds you have while wearing your armor.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>ADAPTABLE ARMOR</strong></h4>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;Armor</em><br />You integrate deployable hooks and fins into your armor, augmenting its mobility. While wearing your modified armor, you gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed, and you can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving your hands free. Additionally, you gain a swim speed equal to your walking speed.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>ADVANCED POWER FIST</strong></h4>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;11th level, Armor</em><br /><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;Prototype Power Fist</em><br />You further modify your modified armor&rsquo;s gauntlet with increased reinforcement and weight. Your modified armor&rsquo;s unarmed strike deals 1d8 kinetic damage. Additionally, your critical hit range with your unarmed strikes increases by 1.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>ARTIFICIALLY INTELLIGENT</strong></h4>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;9th level, Armor</em><br />You install an artificial intelligence into your modified armor. While wearing your modified armor, when you make an ability check, your armor&rsquo;s artificial intelligence can take the Help action.</p>\n<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>BONDED PLATES</strong></h4>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;5th level</em><br />You gain a +1 bonus to AC against melee attacks. This bonus increases to +2 at 9th level and +3 at 13th level.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>COLLAPSIBLE SUIT</strong></h4>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;5th level, Armor</em><br />Your modified armor can collapse into a case for easy storage. When transformed this way the armor is indistinguishable from a normal case and weighs 1/3 its normal weight. As an action you can don or doff the armor, allowing it to transform as needed.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>DARKVISION VISOR</strong></h4>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;Armor</em><br />While wearing your modified armor, you have darkvision to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, this modification increases its range by 30 feet.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>ENHANCED ENDURANCE</strong></h4>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;Armor</em><br />When you are reduced to 0 hit points while wearing your modified armor but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. You can&rsquo;t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>ELECTROSHOCK SHIELD</strong></h4>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;Shield Generator</em><br />You install electroshockers in your shield generator. Whenever an enemy misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to do 1d4 + your Intelligence modifier lightning damage to the attacker.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>FLIGHT</strong></h4>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;9th level, Armor</em><br />You integrate a propulsion system into your modified armor. While wearing your modified armor you have an enhanced flying speed of 30 feet.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>GRAPPLING HARPOON</strong></h4>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;Armor</em><br />Your modified armor gains an integrated grappling harpoon set into your gauntlet. With this harpoon, you can make a ranged weapon attack with a range of 30/60. On a hit, it deals 1d6 kinetic damage. This attack can target a surface, object, or creature.</p>\n<p>A creature struck by this attack is impaled by the harpoon. As an action, a creature can attempt to remove the harpoon. Removing the harpoon requires a Strength check. While the harpoon is stuck in the target, you are connected to the target by a 60 foot cable.</p>\n<p>While the harpoon is deployed, you can use your bonus action to activate the reel, pulling yourself to the location if the target is larger than you. A creature or object your size or smaller is pulled to you. Alternatively, you can opt to release the cable (no action required).</p>\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve used this feature, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you recover and reinsert the harpoon as an action.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>HEAVY SUIT</strong></h4>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;5th level, Armor</em><br />You enhance your suit, making it difficult to move. As a bonus action, you can anchor your feet to the ground. While anchored, your speed is 0, you have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws, and your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift doubles. If it would already double, it instead triples.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>INFILTRATION SUIT</strong></h4>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;Armor</em><br />You install a cloaking device in your modified armor. This device has 2 charges. As an action you can use 1 charge to cast&nbsp;infiltrate&nbsp;targeting yourself.</p>\n<p>The cloaking device regains all expended charges after a long rest.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>MAGNETIZED SHIELD</strong></h4>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;Physical Shield</em><br />You modify your physical shield such that when a melee weapon attack misses you by an amount less than or equal to your bonus to AC from your shield, the attacking creature must make a Strength check against your tech save DC. On a failed save, the creature&rsquo;s weapon adheres to the shield. As an action, a creature can repeat this check. On a success, the weapon is freed.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>OVERLOAD SHIELD</strong></h4>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;Shield Generator</em><br />You modify your shield generator to overload. As an action you can overload your shield. Each Large or smaller creature within 5 feet of you must make a Dexterity or Strength saving throw (their choice) against your tech save DC. On a failed save, they are pushed back 5 feet and knocked prone.</p>\n<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>POWER FIST</strong></h4>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;Armor</em><br />You modify your modified armor gauntlet with increased reinforcement and weight. Your modified armor&rsquo;s unarmed strike deals 1d4 kinetic damage.</p>\n<p>Additionally, when you take the Attack action and make an unarmed attack, you can make an additional unarmed attack as a bonus action.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>PROTOTYPE POWER FIST</strong></h4>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;5th level, Armor</em><br /><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;Power Fist</em><br />You further modify your modified armor gauntlet with increased reinforcement and weight. Your modified armor&rsquo;s unarmed strike deals 1d6 kinetic damage and has the following property.</p>\n<p>If you or your target move at least 10 feet in a straight line immediately before making an unarmed attack, the first unarmed attack you make deals additional damage equal to your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>REINFORCED UNDERLAY</strong></h4>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;5th level</em><br />You gain a +1 bonus to AC against ranged attacks. This bonus increases to +2 at 9th level and +3 at 13th level.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>RESISTANCE</strong></h4>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;Armor</em><br />You tune your modified armor against certain forms of damage. Choose acid, cold, fire, ion, lightning, or sonic damage. While wearing your modified armor you have resistance to that type of damage.</p>\n<p>You can select this modification multiple times. Each time you do so, you must choose a different damage type.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>SEALED SUIT</strong></h4>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;5th level, Armor</em><br />As a bonus action you can hermetically seal your modified armor, giving you an air supply for up to 1 hour and making you immune to poison (but not curing you of existing poisoned conditions). Your armor regains 1 minute of air for every minute that you are not submerged and the armor is not sealed.</p>\n<p>Additionally, while you are wearing your modified armor you are considered adapted to cold and hot climates as well as high altitude, as described in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>SENTIENT ARMOR</strong></h4>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;13th level</em><br /><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;Artificially Intelligent</em><br />Your artificial intelligence has learned to control the suit without you being in it. It is now a valid target of the&nbsp;tracker droid interface&nbsp;tech power.</p>\n<p>While your armor is acting independently, it uses your ability scores, saving throws, and skills, and it has hit points equal to your engineer level. If reduced to 0 hit points, it falls directly to the ground, and it can not be equipped again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>SHIELD AMPLIFIER</strong></h4>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;Shield Generator</em><br />You modify your shield generator to project outward. As a bonus action you can amplify your shield until the start of your next turn. Each creature within 5 feet of you gains a bonus to AC equal to your shield&rsquo;s bonus.</p>\n<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>SHIELD ANCHOR</strong></h4>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;Physical Shield</em><br />You modify your shield to be used as a portable source of cover. As an action, you can anchor or recover the shield. While anchored, you gain no benefit from a shield, and it does not require the use of a hand. Instead, while anchored, a light shield provides one-quarter cover, a medium shield provides half cover, and a large shield provides three-quarters cover.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>TECH BLAST</strong></h4>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;Armor</em><br />You modify your modified armor gauntlet with a blaster weapon with which you are proficient. The weapon uses your Intelligence modifier for its attack and damage rolls, and deals 1d8 energy damage on a hit. It has a normal range of 30 feet and a long range of 120 feet.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>WEAPON INTEGRATION ARMORING</strong></h4>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;Armor</em><br />You can integrate a single weapon that weighs no more than 8 lb. into your armor. While integrated, that weapon gains the hidden property. Additionally, you have advantage on Strength saving throws to avoid being disarmed.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"PHB","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"power"},"className":""},"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[]}

You can learn a vow at the same time you meet its prerequisites.</p>\n<hr />\n<blockquote>\n<h4><strong>VOW OF DEFLECTION</strong></h4>\n<p>You can use your reaction to divert a strike when you are dealt damage by a melee weapon attack. When you do so, the damage taken by the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>VOW OF THE DEVOTED</strong></h4>\n<p>You gain a limited ability to manipulate the Force. See chapter 10 for the general rules of forcecasting and chapter 11 for the force powers list.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Force Powers Known</strong>.&nbsp;You learn 2 force powers of your choice. You learn an additional power at 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th, 13th, 15th, and 17th level. You may not learn a force power of a level higher than your Max Power Level, and you may learn a force power at the same time you learn its prerequisite. You may only learn universal powers in this way.</li>\n<li><strong>Force Points</strong>.&nbsp;Rather than force points, powers you learn through this vow are cast using your focus points, at 1 focus point per power level. You may only cast universal powers in this way.</li>\n<li><strong>Max Power Level</strong>.&nbsp;Many force powers can be overpowered, consuming more focus points to create a greater effect. You can overpower these abilities to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels. Your Max Power Level is 1st. It increases to 2nd at 7th level, 3rd at 13th level, and 4th at 17th level. You may only cast force powers at 4th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.</li>\n<li><strong>Forcecasting Ability.</strong>&nbsp;You use your focus ability whenever a power refers to your forcecasting ability. If a power you cast with focus points calls for a saving throw, you use your focus save DC. If a power you cast with focus points calls for an attack roll, you use your focus attack modifier.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>VOW OF FATE</strong></h4>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;7th level</em><br />When you finish a short or long rest, roll a d20 and record the number rolled. Once before your next short or long rest, you can replace any attack roll, saving throw, or ability check made by you or a creature within 5 feet of you with this roll. You must choose to do so before the roll.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>VOW OF THE FIGHTER</strong></h4>\n<p>You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the fighting Style options, detailed in Chapter 6. You can&rsquo;t take a fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>VOW OF FORTITUDE</strong></h4>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;7th level</em><br />You can use your action or bonus action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be blinded or deafened.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>VOW OF FREEDOM</strong></h4>\n<p>You ignore unenhanced difficult terrain, and when you would use your action to break free of an effect that is grappling or restraining you, you can instead use your bonus action.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>VOW OF INTUITION</strong></h4>\n<p>You can no longer have disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures within 10 feet of you due to not being able to see them.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>VOW OF THE LIMBER</strong></h4>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;7th level</em><br />When you make your first unarmed strike on your turn, you can choose to spend 1 focus point. If you do so, your reach with your unarmed strikes increases by 5 feet until the end of your turn.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>VOW OF METTLE</strong></h4>\n<p>You can use Strength instead of Wisdom or Charisma when determining your Unarmored Defense.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>VOW OF THE MORTAL</strong></h4>\n<p>You can use Constitution instead of Wisdom or Charisma when determining your Unarmored Defense.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>VOW OF THE NEMESIS</strong></h4>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;13th level</em><br />As a bonus action, you can choose one creature within 30 feet that you can see. The creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your focus save DC. On a successful save, the creature becomes immune to this feature for 24 hours.

Additionally, you can spend 1 focus point and 10 minutes meditating on a skill in which you are proficient. If you do so, when you make an ability check with the chosen skill, you can add your Wisdom or Charisma modifier to the check if it doesn&rsquo;t already include that modifier. You can only have one instance of this feature active at a time.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>VOW OF PRECISION</strong></h4>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;13th level</em><br />Your critical hit range with unarmed strikes increases by 1.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>VOW OF REQUITAL</strong></h4>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;13th level</em><br />When you take the Dodge action and an attack made by a creature within 5 feet of you misses you before the start of your next turn, you can use your reaction to make one melee weapon attack with a monk weapon or unarmed strike against that creature.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>VOW OF RESTORATION</strong></h4>\n<p>When you would make an unarmed strike, you can spend 1 focus point to instead touch a willing creature within your reach. Roll your Martial Arts die. The target gains hit points equal to the amount rolled + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of +1).</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>VOW OF THE SENTRY</strong></h4>\n<p>You gain proficiency in light and medium armor.

Once before your next short or long rest, you can replace any attack roll, saving throw, or ability check made by you or a creature within 5 feet of you with this roll. You must choose to do so before the roll.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>FIGHTER&rsquo;S EXPLOIT</strong></h4>\n<p>You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the fighting Style options, detailed in Chapter 6. You can&rsquo;t take a fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>FREEDOM&rsquo;S EXPLOIT</strong></h4>\n<p>You ignore unenhanced difficult terrain, and when you would use your action to break free of an effect that is grappling or restraining you, you can instead use your bonus action.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>GUERRILLA&rsquo;S EXPLOIT</strong></h4>\n<p>You only need 4 hours of sleep to gain the benefit of a long rest.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you have advantage on saving throws against exhaustion.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>LEARNER&rsquo;S EXPLOIT</strong></h4>\n<p>You gain proficiency in a skill and a tool, or two tools.</p>\n<p>You can select this discovery multiple times, each time choosing a new skill and a tool, or two new tools.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>MENTOR&rsquo;S EXPLOIT</strong></h4>\n<p>Prerequisite:&nbsp;13th level<br />Once per turn, whenever both you and a friendly creature within 60 feet that can see and hear you both have to make a saving throw to resist the same effect, you can choose to have disadvantage on the save. If you do so, the friendly creature gains advantage on the save. You can use this feature before or after you both make the saving throw, but you must do so before the GM says whether the save succeeds or fails.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>SKILL&rsquo;S EXPLOIT</strong></h4>\n<p>You learn an exploit that enhances your ability to apply your knowledge to combat situations. You can take this exploit multiple times.</p>\n<p>When you take the Attack action, you can use one of your skill exploits granted by this feature. You can use these features a combined number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p>Choose from the following. You must be proficient in the skill in order to take that skill&rsquo;s exploit.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Aim (Stealth)</strong>.&nbsp;You attempt to line up a strike against a creature you can see that you are hidden from. Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check contested by the target&rsquo;s Wisdom (Perception) check. If your check succeeds, you gain a +10 bonus to the first attack roll you make against the target before the end of your next turn. If your check fails, you are no longer hidden from the target.</li>\n<li><strong>Angle (Perception)</strong>.&nbsp;You attempt to predict the behavior of a humanoid you can see within 30 feet. Make a Wisdom (Perception) check contested by the target&rsquo;s Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. If your check succeeds, the first attack roll the target makes before the start of your next turn has disadvantage, and the first saving throw the creature makes before the start of your next turn has disadvantage. If your check fails, you can&rsquo;t use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.</li>\n<li><strong>Battle Cry (Intimidation)</strong>.&nbsp;You attempt to demoralize one humanoid you can see within 30 feet of you that can see and hear you. Make a Charisma (Intimidation) check contested by the target&rsquo;s Wisdom (Insight) check. If your check succeeds, the target is frightened until the end of your next turn. If the target was already frightened of you, it must immediately drop whatever it is holding. On its next turn, if it is still frightened of you, it must take the Dash action and move away from you by the safest available route on its turn, unless there is nowhere to move. If your check fails, you can&rsquo;t use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.</li>\n<li><strong>Charm (Persuasion)</strong>.&nbsp;You attempt to convince one humanoid you can see within 30 feet that can hear and understand you. Make a Charisma (Persuasion) check contested by the target&rsquo;s Wisdom (Insight) check. If you have dealt damage to the creature in the last hour, it has advantage on the check. If your check succeeds, the target is charmed by you until the start of your next turn, and it has disadvantage on the first attack roll it makes against a creature before the end of its next turn. If your check fails, you can&rsquo;t use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.</li>\n<li><strong>Confuse Beast (Animal Handling)</strong>.&nbsp;You attempt to confuse one beast on the battlefield. Make a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check contested by the target&rsquo;s Wisdom (Insight) check. If your check succeeds, the beast cannot take actions or reactions until the end of your next turn. If your check fails, you can&rsquo;t use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.</li>\n<li><strong>Distract (Performance)</strong>.&nbsp;You attempt to distract one beast or humanoid you can see within 30 feet of you that can see and hear you. Make a Charisma (Performance) check contested by the target&rsquo;s Wisdom (Insight) check. If your check succeeds, the next attack roll made against the target before the start of its next turn has advantage. If your check fails, you can&rsquo;t use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.</li>\n<li><strong>Emulate Predator (Nature)</strong>.&nbsp;You attempt to emulate the sounds of a natural predator of a beast or plant you can see within 30 feet.

If your check succeeds, the target must take the Dash action and move away from you by the safest available route on its turn, unless there is nowhere to move. If your check fails, you can&rsquo;t use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.</li>\n<li><strong>Feint (Deception)</strong>.&nbsp;You attempt to divert the attention of a target you can see within 30 feet. Make a Charisma (Deception) check contested by the target&rsquo;s Wisdom (Insight) check. If your check succeeds, the first attack roll made against the target before the start of your next turn by someone other than you has advantage, and the target has disadvantage on the first saving throw they make against an effect caused by a creature other than you before the start of your next turn. If your check fails, the target can&rsquo;t be deceived by you in this way for 1 hour.</li>\n<li><strong>Hacktivate (Technology)</strong>.&nbsp;You attempt to determine the weaknesses in a droid you can see within 30 feet. Make an Intelligence (Technology) check contested by the target&rsquo;s Intelligence (Technology) check. If your check succeeds, you have advantage on the next attack roll you make against the target before the end of your turn, and if you hit, you deal additional damage equal to your Intelligence modifier. If your check fails, you can&rsquo;t use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.</li>\n<li><strong>Instruct (Investigation)</strong>.&nbsp;You attempt to find a weakness in your target. Make an Intelligence (Investigation) check contested by the target&rsquo;s Charisma (Deception) check. If your check succeeds, if a friendly creature makes an attack roll against the target and they can see and hear you, you can use your reaction to grant them advantage on the roll. If you do so, and they hit, they deal additional damage equal to your bonus to Investigation checks. This damage is the same type as the attack&rsquo;s damage. If your check fails, you can&rsquo;t use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.</li>\n<li><strong>Intuit (Insight)</strong>.&nbsp;You attempt to determine the motivations of one humanoid you can see within 30 feet. Make a Wisdom (Insight) check contested by the target&rsquo;s Charisma (Deception) check. If your check succeeds, the target can&rsquo;t have advantage on ability checks, attack rolls, or saving throws against you until the end of your next turn. If your check fails, the target instead can&rsquo;t have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, or saving throws against you until the end of your next turn.</li>\n<li><strong>Tumble (Acrobatics)</strong>.&nbsp;You attempt to make a quick tumble, immediately moving 10 feet. If you begin or end this movement within a creature&rsquo;s reach, make a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by it&rsquo;s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If your check succeeds, this movement does not provoke opportunity attacks from it, and you have advantage on the first attack roll you make against it before the end of your turn. If your check fails, you immediately fall prone.</li>\n<li><strong>Pocket Sand (Sleight of Hand)</strong>.&nbsp;You attempt to blind one beast or humanoid you can see within 15 feet of you. Make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check contested by the target&rsquo;s Wisdom (Perception) check. If your check succeeds, the target is blinded until the end of your turn. If your check fails, you can&rsquo;t use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.</li>\n<li><strong>Precision Strike (Medicine)</strong>.&nbsp;You attempt to strike a pressure point in one humanoid within your reach. Make a Wisdom (Medicine) check contested by the target&rsquo;s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If your check succeeds, they are incapacitated until the end of their next turn. If your check fails, you can&rsquo;t use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.</li>\n<li><strong>Snare (Survival)</strong>.&nbsp;You attempt to cause a creature within 30 feet of you to stumble. Make a Wisdom (Survival) check contested by the target&rsquo;s Wisdom (Perception) check. If your check succeeds, and the target moves towards you before the start of your next turn, it gains 1 slowed level, and you can use your reaction to cause it to fall prone. If your check fails, you can&rsquo;t use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.</li>\n<li><strong>Spin (Piloting)</strong>.&nbsp;You attempt to confound a piloted construct you can see within 30 feet. Make an Intelligence (Piloting) check contested by the target&rsquo;s Intelligence (Piloting) check. If your check succeeds, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls against you, and you have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against the target, until the start of your next turn. If your check fails, the target instead has advantage on attack rolls against you, and you have disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws against the target, until the start of your next turn.</li>\n<li><strong>Study (Lore)</strong>.&nbsp;You attempt to anticipate your target&rsquo;s action. Make an Intelligence (Lore) check contested by the target&rsquo;s Charisma (Deception) check. If your check succeeds, you have advantage on the first ability check, attack roll or saving throw you make against that creature before the end of your next turn. Alternatively, before the end of your next turn, you can use your reaction to grant disadvantage on the first ability check, attack roll, or saving throw the target makes against you. If your check fails, you instead have disadvantage on the first ability check, attack roll or saving throw you make against that creature before the end of your next turn.</li>\n<li><strong>Wrestle (Athletics)</strong>.&nbsp;You attempt to grab and pin a creature within 5 feet of you with at least one free hand. The target must be no more than one size larger than you. Make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target&rsquo;s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If your check succeeds, the target is both grappled and restrained by you. If the target stops being grappled, it also stops being restrained. If your check fails, you can&rsquo;t use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>TECHNOLOGIST&rsquo;S EXPLOIT</strong></h4>\n<p>Choose one 1st-level tech power.

You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Strength (Athletics) check against your feature save DC. When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 kinetic damage and is caught in the vortex until the feature ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, and isn't caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but has disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so. The first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object takes 2d8 kinetic damage; this damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex.</blockquote>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"EC","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"power"},"className":"","requirements":""},"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[]}

A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<h4><strong>SAVING THROWS</strong></h4>\n<p>Some of your maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver&rsquo;s effects.

When you do so, choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you and expend one superiority die. That creature can immediately use its reaction to make one weapon attack, adding the superiority die to the attack&rsquo;s damage roll.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>DISARMING ATTACK</strong></h4>\n<p>When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to disarm the target, forcing it to drop one item of your choice that it&rsquo;s holding. You add the superiority die to the attack&rsquo;s damage roll, and the target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it drops the object you choose. The object lands at its feet.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>DISTRACTING STRIKE</strong></h4>\n<p>When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to distract the creature, giving your allies an opening.

You have advantage on your next attack roll against that creature. If that attack hits, add the superiority die to the attack&rsquo;s damage roll.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>GOADING ATTACK</strong></h4>\n<p>When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to goad the target into attacking you. You add the superiority die to the attack&rsquo;s damage roll, and the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on all attack rolls against targets other than you until the end of your next turn.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>LUNGING ATTACK</strong></h4>\n<p>When you make a melee weapon attack on your turn, you can expend one superiority die to increase your reach for that attack by 5 feet. If you hit, you add the superiority die to the attack&rsquo;s damage roll.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>MANEUVERING ATTACK</strong></h4>\n<p>When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to maneuver one of your comrades into a more advantageous position. You add the superiority die to the attack&rsquo;s damage roll, and you choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you.</p>\n<p>That creature can use its reaction to move up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks from the target of your attack.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>MENACING ATTACK</strong></h4>\n<p>When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to frighten the target. You add the superiority die to the attack&rsquo;s damage roll, and the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it is frightened of you until the end of your next turn.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>PARRY</strong></h4>\n<p>When another creature damages you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction and expend one superiority die to reduce the damage by the number you roll on your superiority die + your Dexterity modifier.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>PRECISION ATTACK</strong></h4>\n<p>When you make a weapon attack roll against a creature, you can expend one superiority die to add it to the roll. You can use this maneuver before or after making the attack roll, but before any effects of the attack are applied.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>PUSHING ATTACK</strong></h4>\n<p>When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to drive the target back. You add the superiority die to the attack&rsquo;s damage roll, and if the target is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you push the target up to 15 feet away from you.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>RALLY</strong></h4>\n<p>On your turn, you can use a bonus action and expend one superiority die to bolster the resolve of one of your companions. When you do so, choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you. That creature gains temporary hit points equal to the superiority die roll + your Charisma modifier.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>RIPOSTE</strong></h4>\n<p>When a creature misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction and expend one superiority die to make a melee weapon attack against the creature. If you hit, you add the superiority die to the attack&rsquo;s damage roll.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>SWEEPING ATTACK</strong></h4>\n<p>When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to damage another creature with the same attack. Choose another creature within 5 feet of the original target and within your reach. If the original attack roll would hit the second creature, it takes damage equal to the number you roll on your superiority die. The damage is of the same type dealt by the original attack.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>TRIP ATTACK</strong></h4>\n<p>When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to knock the target down. You add the superiority die to the attack&rsquo;s damage roll, and if the target is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw.

If you lack a tech focus, you can instead direct it while it is within 5 feet of you. Your portable structure has the following features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Its AC equals your tech save DC.</li>\n<li>It has a number of hit points equal to 5 x your engineer level. If your structure is reduced to 0 hit points, it collapses and can't be use again until you spend 1 hour repairing it. which can be done during a short or long rest.</li>\n<li>You can restore missing hit points to your structure by casting the mending tech power on it. or by completing a short or long rest.

Automatic dismantling of your structure takes 1 minute, and can be initiated on your turn (no action required).</p>\n<p>You can deploy your choice from these structures a combined total of four times, and you gain more uses at higher levels, as shown in the Modification Slots column of the engineer table. Each time you use this feature in excess of your proficiency bonus, your tech point maximum is reduced by 1 until you complete a long rest. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Bridge</strong></h3>\n<p>You deploy a bridge up to 30 feet long, 10 feet wide, and 3 feet thick. The bridge starts from the point at which you deploy it, and extends in a direction of your choice. When you dismantle your bridge, it retracts to the point at which you initially deployed it. Both ends of the bridge must be supported in some function; one end cannot be suspended in the air or on unstable terrain. The bridge can hold up to 1,000 lbs., any weight above which causes the bridge to instantly drop to 0 hit points, destroying it. If a creature is on the bridge when it is destroyed or dismantled, it must make a Dexterity saving throw against your tech save DC. On a successful saving throw, it reaches the closest part of the bridge that has stable support, or it maintains a grip on your bridge as it retracts, as appropriate. On a failed save, it falls.</p>\n<p>When you reach 11th level, the bridge can now extend up to 45 feet long, 15 feet wide, and it can support up to 2,000 lbs.

The cube is surrounded on all sides except the ground by 2-foot-thick walls. The walls and roof are completely opaque, and you choose whether the structure has a light source when you deploy it that provides bright light within the cube. Otherwise, the space within the cube is in complete darkness. The cage is permeable, as air, water, and sound passes through it You can attempt to trap unwilling Medium or smaller creatures inside the cage. When you deploy this structure in an unwilling creature's space, it must make a Dexterity saving throw against your tech save DC. On a successful save, it can immediately move to nearest unoccupied space outside the sage. Otherwise, it is trapped within the structure when it is deployed.</p>\n<p>When you reach 11th level, the cage can extend up to 15 feet on each side, and it can trap creatures of Large size or smaller. When you reach 17th level, the cage can extend up to 20 feet on each side, and it can trap creatures of Huge size or smaller.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Shelter</strong></h3>\n<p>You erect a shelter up to 15 feet long, 10 feet wide, 10 feet tall, with one-foot-thick walls, a roof, and a floor. It has a single door along its walls in a location of your choice. The building has temperature control and lighting systems, and can withstand harsh winds, heavy rain and snow. Any creature inside the shelter is protected from hazardous environmental effects outside the shelter such as extreme heat or cold. The structure does not provide additional breathing air for anyone inside if the environment it is placed in is not breathable. The house can comfortably support up to 5 Medium creatures. For each Medium creature, it can instead support 2 Small creatures. For each Small creature, it can instead support 2 Tiny creatures.</p>\n<p>When you reach 11 th level, the house can extend up to 30 feet long, 15 feet wide, 15 feet tall, and it can now comfortable support up to 10 Medium creatures.

Additionally, when a creature completes a long rest while within your shelter, they regain all spent Hit Dice, instead of only half. When you reach 17th level, the house can extend up to 45 feet long 20 feet wide, 20 feet tall, and it can now comfortable support up to 10 Large creatures. For each Large creature, it can instead support 2 Medium creatures. For each Medium creature, it can instead support 2 Small creatures. For each Small creature, it can instead support 2 Tiny creatures. Additionally, when a creature completes a long rest while within your shelter, their exhaustion level is reduced by 2, instead of only 1.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Tower</strong></h3>\n<p>You erect a tower from a 5-foot square platform centered on the target location that rises up to 30 feet. If the tower is created under a creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be lifted by the tower. A creature can choose to fail the save. The tower comes equipped with a ladder that reaches from the ground to the platform.</p>\n<p>When you reach 11 th level, the tower's platform can extend 5 feet by 10 feet and rise up to 40 feet When you reach 17th level, the tower's platform can cover a 10-foot square, and rise up to 50 feet. Additionally, any creature on the tower's platform has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Wall</strong></h3>\n<p>You deploy a wall up to 30 feet long 10 feet high, and 3 feet thick, or a ringed wall up to 10 feet in diameter, 10 feet high, and 3 feet thick. The wall features ramparts deep enough to support creatures of Medium size or smaller, and provides one-quarter cover to any creature on its ramparts. The wall includes a ladder on the side of your choice. You choose whether the wall contains any openings otherwise. Any openings chosen in this way can be seen through on both sides. The wall can be climbed, but requires a Strength (Athletics) check against your tech save DC for any creature without a climbing speed. A creature can only make this check once per turn.</p>\n<p>When you reach 11 th level, the wall can deploy up to 45 feet long and 15 feet high, or a ringed wall up to 15 feet in diameter and 15 feet high. Additionally, the wall now provides half cover to any creature on its ramparts. When you reach 17th level, the wall can deploy up to 60 feet long and 20 feet high, or a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter and 20 feet high.

Many ammunition enhancements boost an attack in some way. Once per turn when you fire a shot from a blaster as part of the Attack action, you can apply one of your Ammunition Enhancement options to that shot,</p>\n<p>You gain an additional Ammunition Enhancement option of your choice when you reach certain levels in this class: 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level. Each option also improves when you become an 18th-level fighter.</p>\n<p>Each time you learn new ammunition enhancements, you can also replace one ammunition enhancement you know with a different one.</p>\n<h4><strong>AMPLIFIED SHOTS</strong></h4>\n<p>You have two amplified shots, which you use to activate your ammunition enhancements. An amplified shot is expended when you use it. When you fire an amplified shot, your weapon is treated as enhanced for overcoming resistance and immunity to unenhanced attacks and damage. You decide to use the option when the shot hits a creature, unless the option doesn&rsquo;t involve an attack roll. You regain all of your amplified shots when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<h4><strong>SAVING THROWS</strong></h4>\n<p>Some of your ammunition enhancements require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver&rsquo;s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Ammunition save DC&nbsp;</strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>AMMUNITION ENHANCEMENTS</h2>\n<p>The ammunition enhancements are presented in alphabetical order.</p>\n<hr />\n<blockquote>\n<h4><strong>CARBONITE SHOT</strong></h4>\n<p>When this shot strikes its target, shards of carbonite wrap around the target. The creature hit by the shot takes an extra 2d6 cold damage, it gains 1 slowed level, and it takes 2d6 kinetic damage the first time on each turn it moves 1 foot or more without teleporting. The target or any creature that can reach it can use its action to remove the carbonite with a successful Strength (Athletics) check against your Special Ammunition save DC. Otherwise, the carbonite lasts for 1 minute or until you use this option again.</p>\n<p>The cold damage and kinetic damage both increase to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>COERCING SHOT</strong></h4>\n<p>You enhance your shot with chemicals that confuse the target. The creature hit by the shot takes an extra 2d6 poison damage, and choose one of your allies within 30 feet of the target. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or it is charmed by the chosen ally until the start of your next turn. This effect ends early if the chosen ally attacks the charmed target, deals damage to it, or forces it to make a saving throw.</p>\n<p>The poison damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>EXPLOSIVE SHOT</strong></h4>\n<p>You fire a shot set to explode on impact. The shot detonates after your attack. Immediately after the shot hits the creature, the target and all other creatures within 10 feet of it take 2d6 fire damage each.</p>\n<p>The fire damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>HALLUCINOGEN SHOT</strong></h4>\n<p>You enhance your shot with hallucinogenic chemicals. The creature hit by the shot takes an extra 2d6 psychic damage, and it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be unable to see anything farther than 5 feet away until the start of your next turn.</p>\n<p>The psychic damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>PIERCING SHOT</strong></h4>\n<p>You enhance your shot with armor-piercing properties. When you use this option, you don&rsquo;t make an attack roll for the attack. Instead, the shot shoots forward in a line, which is 1 foot wide and 30 feet long, before disappearing. The shot passes through objects, ignoring cover. Each creature in that line must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes damage as if it were hit by the shot, plus an extra 1d6 damage of the weapon&rsquo;s type. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage.</p>\n<p>The extra damage increases to 2d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>QUELL SHOT</strong></h4>\n<p>You fire a shot enhanced with a debilitating poison. The creature hit by the shot takes an extra 2d6 poison damage. The target must also succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or the damage dealt by its weapon attacks is halved until the start of your next turn.</p>\n<p>The poison damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>SEEKING SHOT</strong></h4>\n<p>You apply a tracing signal to your shot. When you use this option, you don&rsquo;t make an attack roll for the attack. Instead, choose one creature you have seen in the past minute. The shot flies toward that creature, moving around corners if necessary and ignoring three-quarters cover and half cover. If the target is within the weapon&rsquo;s range and there is a path large enough for the shot to travel to the target, the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. Otherwise, the shot disappears after traveling as far as it can. On a failed save, the target takes damage as if it were hit by the shot, plus an extra 1d6 kinetic damage, and you learn the target&rsquo;s current location. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage, and you don&rsquo;t learn its location.</p>\n<p>The kinetic damage increases to 2d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.</p>\n</blockquote>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"EC","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"power"},"className":""},"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[]}

Lastly, while active, you can use Strength instead of Dexterity when determining your AC, as long as it doesn't already include that modifier.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Fire</strong></h3>\n<p>Your flaming weapon sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet, deals fire damage, and when you hit a creature with it, the creature takes additional damage equal to half your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, rounded up, minimum of one).</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Water</strong></h3>\n<p>Your watery weapon has the reach property, deals cold damage on a hit, and you can use your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice) instead of Dexterity or Strength for its attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls. Additionally, when you would make a melee weapon attack, you can instead use your weapon to wet a 5-foot square within your weapon's reach. The affected area is difficult terrain. Each creature who starts its turn in the square or enters it for the first time must make a Dexterity saving throw, falling prone on a failed save.</p>\n</blockquote>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"EC","activation":{"type":"action","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":"","amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"power"},"className":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false},"requirements":""},"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[]}

You learn two totems of your choice, which are detailed under &ldquo;Totems&rdquo; below.

Your totem remains affixed until you finish a long rest, and an object can only bear one totem at a time. You must be wielding or wearing the object to benefit from a totem affixed to it.</p>\n<p>Each totem can be invoked to grant an effect. Once you&rsquo;ve invoked a totem in this way, you can&rsquo;t do so again until you complete a short or long rest.</p>\n<h2>TOTEM OPTIONS</h2>\n<p>The totems are listed in alphabetical order. If a totem requires a saving throw, the DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice).</p>\n<hr />\n<blockquote>\n<h4><strong>TOTEM OF THE ACKLAY</strong></h4>\n<p>This totem evokes the ferocity of an acklay, granting you advantage on Intelligence (Nature) checks and Charisma (Intimidation) checks.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you can invoke the totem as a bonus action. For 10 minutes, your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift doubles, and your Strength score increases by 2. This increase can cause your score to exceed 20.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>TOTEM OF THE HAWK</strong></h4>\n<p>This totem is inspired by the visage of a hawk, granting you advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) checks, and darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, its range increases by 30 feet.</p>\n<p>Additionally, when a creature you can see ends its turn within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to invoke the totem and force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw by emitting a powerful sound. Unless the save succeeds, the creature is dazed, suffering from the Charmed condition. While charmed in this way, the creature has a speed of 0 and is incapacitated. The effect ends if the charmed creature takes any damage or if someone else uses an action to shake the creature out of its haze. Once you invoke the totem, you can&rsquo;t do so again until you finish a short or long rest. A deaf creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>TOTEM OF THE LOTH-WOLF</strong></h4>\n<p>This totem emulates the near etherealness of a loth-wolf, granting you advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks and Charisma (Deception) checks.</p>\n<p>Additionally, when you or a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is hit by an attack roll, you can use your reaction to invoke the totem and cause that attack to target a different creature within 30 feet of you (other than the attacker) that you can see, using the same roll. This ability can transfer the attack regardless of the attack&rsquo;s range.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>TOTEM OF THE RANCOR</strong></h4>\n<p>This totem bestows a resilience reminiscent of a mighty rancor, granting you advantage on saving throws against being poisoned and resistance to poison damage.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you can invoke the totem as a bonus action, gaining resistance to energy and kinetic damage for 1 minute.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>TOTEM OF THE SARLACC</strong></h4>\n<p>This totem channels the experience of an ancient sarlacc, granting you expertise in any tool in which you are proficient.</p>\n<p>Additionally, when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can invoke the totem to summon the tentacles of the creature: The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained for 1 minute. While restrained by the tentacles, the target takes 2d6 acid damage at the start of each of its turns. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, tearing free on a success.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>TOTEM OF THE VORNSKR</strong></h4>\n<p>With this totem you are able to access the Force-enhanced senses of the vornskr, granting you advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks, and you can&rsquo;t be surprised as long as you are not incapacitated.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you can invoke the totem as a bonus action to enter a state of hyper awareness for 1 minute or until you&rsquo;re incapacitated. Until the state ends, when you or another creature you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, a saving throw, or an ability check, you can use your reaction to cause the roll to have advantage or disadvantage.</p>\n</blockquote>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"EC","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"power"},"className":""},"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[]}
