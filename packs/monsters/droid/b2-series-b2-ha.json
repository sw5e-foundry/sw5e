They were manufactured after the Invasion of Naboo proved the need for stronger droids. B2s were used by the Trade Federation, the Techno Union, and later, on a much larger scale, the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Some units were later reactivated on Mustafar by Gizor Dellso and other members of the Separatist holdouts, and the Galactic Alliance also used some B2 units during the Yuuzhan Vong War.</p><h3 style=\"font-family:&quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif\">Characteristics</h3><p>One of the main design flaws of the standard B1 battle droid was its reliance on a Droid Control Ship to provide a signal; if the ships were disabled, the battle droids would become useless. To remedy this, the super battle droid did not rely on such a signal and had a greater capacity for independence. However, the droid still operated best with a command signal, otherwise, they tended to forget about enemies as soon as they moved out of visual range. Additionally, the sturdy duranium and phrik frame of the super battle droid was larger and more heavily armored than those of a B1.<br /></p><p>Unlike its predecessor, the B2's delicate processing unit and signal receptor were buried deep inside the torso, offering much more protection from enemy fire. Small fully-automatic dual laser cannons were mounted on their right forearms or even both forearms as seen in the Mission to Rugosa. In some cases the weapons were replaced with a TriShot weapon system. The B2-HA model's left forearm was replaced by a rocket launcher. They could use external weaponry (except in rocket launcher configuration), though their large hands had difficulty with smaller blasters. Instead, they were equipped with special blasters that only responded to signal emitters built into the hands. For the sake of efficiency, they used many B1 parts. Their feet were also outfitted with specialized equipment for difficult terrains, such as climbing claws. Their arms also were modular, capable of exchanging their laser cannons for other specialized weaponry.<br /></p><p>When they were not using their built-in laser cannons, they had their right forearm locked upright.<br /></p><p>As heavy infantry droids, B2s could take much more punishment than their flimsy predecessors. Even after being defeated, they could detach their torsos and keep up an attack although this was detrimental to their combat skill. Despite such traits, some models seemingly suffered low heat tolerance and were subject to bursting into flame upon contact.<br /></p><p>Most post-Battle of Geonosis B2 droids were capable of communicating with each other using an oversimplified version of Galactic Basic Standard.<br /></p><h3 style=\"font-family:&quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif\">History</h3><p><b>Clone Wars</b></p><blockquote><p><i>\"They've sent in the supers!\"</i></p><p>- Various clone troopers</p></blockquote><p>The B2 was preceded by the lesser-used prototype beta version. Soon after the Invasion of Naboo, the Trade Federation was researching a new type of battle droid. Commandos from the Royal Naboo Security Forces seized the research facility and discovered the data about this new battle droid.</p><p>During their first deployment at the Kashyyyk Trade Rebellion in 28 BBY, the new B2 designs proved to be a match for the local Wookiee warriors.<br /></p><p>Super battle droids saw use throughout the Clone Wars as soldiers for the Confederacy along with its smaller cousins and the dreaded droidekas. Most super battle droids wore an unpainted dull silver tone, likely to differentiate them from the tan coloration the Confederacy used for its standard battle droids, or perhaps due to varying manufacturers. On occasion, they would be painted with green markings for camouflage.<br /></p><p>Some Super Battle Droids were used as scouts to observe the plains of Geonosis, mostly because of their brute strength and their ability to destroy modest ground targets. This pleased many of the local Geonosians affiliated with the CIS, thus sometimes using the B2s as \"spire guards.\"</p><p>The droids eventually were able to express certain emotions, though having catastrophic grammar. They possessed a more violent temperament than the B1 model, to the point they would even strike down allied units in order to quickly intercept enemy targets, as seen in the First Battle of Geonosis. As well as that, they were also considerably more durable and intelligent, capable of easily withstanding light blaster bolts.</p><p>Super battle droids were often retrofitted with adversarial specific parts. However, this method was introduced late in the war and had little effect on the outcome of the conflict. One known model change was the introduction of the grapple droid, which had heavier armor and a larger frame. This droid was programmed to be a close combat model able to receive primary lightsaber slashes and disable enemies through its electrified claws. Another specialized variant was involved in the release of the swamp gas toxin on Ohma-D'un. The D-60 assault droid, another variant, was used in the Battle of Cartao by CIS forces. two jetpack-equipped variants of the droid, the jump droid, and the rocket droid, were also developed. Other variants included super battle droids armed with various weapons, such as the Mortar Super Battle Droid, the Anti-Air Super Battle Droid, and the Repeater super battle droid. A more heavily armed and armored version was the Heavy super battle droid, and orray troopers were B2 droids armed with flamethrowers which rode orrays. These variants were produced at Geonosian troop centers.<br /></p><p>During the third battle of Felucia, the Separatist deployed an experimental model of super battle droid. This model was the B2 Assault, which was an upgraded version of the preexisting B2-HA super droid. During the battle the CIS also deployed the B2 soldier, and this model of super battle droid was used to attack a Republic outpost staffed by Graul Company, and these units had green markings.<br /></p><p>The B2 battle droid was designed by the Techno Union using the existing B1 design as a template. After prototypes were successfully tested, Count Dooku struck a deal with Poggle the Lesser, Archduke of Geonosis, to mass produce these droids.<br /></p><p>Further orders were placed on worlds controlled by Baktoid and quadrillions of B2s were soon running off the assembly lines. Despite their advantages and ease of production, however, they were not manufactured as extensively as their inferior cousins, the B1s.<br /></p><p>During the Clone Wars, B2s would become an important component of the Separatist Droid Army. They participated in most battles in that conflict including the Battle of Geonosis, Battle of Muunilinst, Battle of Coruscant, and Battle of Kashyyyk, and innumerable others throughout the galaxy. B2s were used as shooting range targets as part of the training of clone sharpshooters. A training model was used on Kamino for the training of Clone cadets.<br /></p><p>Following the execution of the Separatist Council by Darth Sidious's new apprentice, Darth Vader, the B2s were deactivated.<br /></p><p><b>Post-Clone Wars<br /></b></p><p>A few years after Order 66, Gizor Dellso reactivated a droid factory on Mustafar. Among the reactivated production lines were a few lines that produced B2 battle droids, providing Dellso with an acceptable amount of B2's in his droid army.</p><p>After the Clone Wars, a few entrepreneurs found warehouses filled with the droids. Many were sold to gangs or major crime lords for enforcement. Others would be used by the various Separatist holdouts. Like some B1 battle droids, B2s were also used as guards inside the Death Watch bunker on Endor. Borvo the Hutt owned several super battle droids to defend his vault on Naboo.</p><p>During the Yuuzhan Vong's invasion of the galaxy, many B2 droids used by the Galactic Alliance made up a force known as the Orange Panthacs, which beat back an occupation force of Fire Breathers on Mantessa.</p>",
