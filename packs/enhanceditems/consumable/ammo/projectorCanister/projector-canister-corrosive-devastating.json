A single fuel canister holds enough fuel for three attacks in a line or a single attack in a cone. Each creature must make a DC 24 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes [[/r 6d6]] acid damage, and the first attack it makes before the end of its next turn has disadvantage. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and isn't disadvantaged. If this damage reduces a creature to 0 hit points, it must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it dies immediately without making death saving throws. A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing and carrying are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust.
