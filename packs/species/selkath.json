      "value": "<h2>Biology &amp; Appearance</h2>\n<p>The Selkath are an aquatic species, known for being skilled swimmers and diplomats. Their heads resemble sting rays and they have a blue, pink, or green skin naturally patterned as an underwater camouflage. Their mouths are bracketed by cephalic lobes. Female Selkath differed from males due to the presence of tendrils on the back of their heads.</p>\n<p>All members of the Selkath race have rectractable, venom-tipped claws. The use of these claws in any form of combat or attack was considered dishonorable and a sign of madness; to do this was to give in to animal instincts unbecoming of a sentient species. Because of the Selkath's water-dwelling nature, their chest armors were fitted with misting vents in order to keep their skin moist.</p>\n<h2>Society &amp; Culture</h2>\n<p>Selkath are native to the planet Manaan, the only naturally occurring source of the medical liquid referred to as kolto. The Selkath have leveraged this monopoly on maintain their neutrality, peddling their invaluable healing supplies to all comers.</p>\n<p>Manaan is an ocean planet is home to only one above-surface settlement, the floating Ahto City, built directly above Hrakert Rift, the most abundant source of kolto on Manaan.  As bacta began to replace the inferior kolto on the galactic stage, Manaan fell from their previously respected position, shirking away their previous prestige and causing many Selkath to disappear from the galactic eye into isolationism and tribalism. </p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Selkath names tend to have a flowing quality to it, like a stream of water. They rarely use surnames.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Chata, Galas, Qual, Morgo, Shaelas</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Halsuna, Dolmas, Shasa, Ulsuru</p>",
