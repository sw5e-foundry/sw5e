If the target has one-quarter cover, you ignore it entirely.</li>\n<li>When you take the Attack action, you can choose to forgo one or more attacks to  <strong>scramble</strong>. For each attack you forgo, you can move up to 10 feet without provoking opportunity attacks. If you could already scramble, instead you can do so as your bonus action.</li></ul>",
