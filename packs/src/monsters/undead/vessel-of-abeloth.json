On a failed save, you create a phantasmal object, creature, or other visible phenomenon of your choice that is no larger than a 10-foot cube and that is perceivable only to the target for the duration. This power has no effect on droids or constructs.</p>\n<p>The hallucination includes sound, temperature, and other stimuli, also evident only to the creature.</p>\n<p>The target can use its action to examine the hallucination with an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your force power save DC. If the check succeeds, the target realizes that the hallucination is an illusion, and the power ends.</p>\n<p>While a target is affected by the power, the target treats the hallucination as if it were real. The target rationalizes any illogical outcomes from interacting with the hallucination. For example, a target attempting to walk across a phantasmal bridge that spans a chasm falls once it steps onto the bridge. If the target survives the fall, it still believes that the bridge exists and comes up with some other explanation for its fall - it was pushed, it slipped, or a strong wind might have knocked it off.</p>\n<p>An affected target is so convinced of the hallucination's reality that it can even take damage from the illusion. A hallucination created to appear as a creature can attack the target. Similarly, a hallucination created to appear as fire, a pool of acid, or lava can burn the target. Each round on your turn, the hallucination can deal 1d6 psychic damage to the target if it is in the hallucination's area or within 5 feet of the hallucination, provided that the illusion is of a creature or hazard that could logically deal damage, such as by attacking. The target perceives the damage as a type appropriate to the illusion.</p>\n<p><strong>Force Potency</strong>.&nbsp;When you cast this power using a force power slot of 3rd level or higher, the range increases by 20 feet, the image dimensions increase by 5 feet, and you can target one additional creature for every two slot levels above 2nd.</p>",

For the duration, an intense tremor rips through the ground in a 100-foot-radius circle centered on that point and shakes creatures and structures in contact with the ground in that area.</p>\n<p>The ground in the area becomes difficult terrain. Each creature on the ground that is concentrating must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature&rsquo;s concentration is broken.</p>\n<p>When you cast this power and at the end of each turn you spend concentrating on it, each creature on the ground in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone.</p>\n<p>This power can have additional effects depending on the terrain in the area, as determined by the GM.</p>\n<p><strong>Fissures.</strong>&nbsp;Fissures open throughout the power&rsquo;s area at the start of your next turn after you cast the power. A total of 1d6 such fissures open in locations chosen by the GM. Each is 1d10 x 10 feet deep, 10 feet wide, and extends from one edge of the power&rsquo;s area to the opposite side. A creature standing on a spot where a fissure opens must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall in. A creature that successfully saves moves with the fissure&rsquo;s edge as it opens.</p>\n<p>A fissure that opens beneath a structure causes it to automatically collapse (see below).</p>\n<p><strong>Structures.&nbsp;</strong>The tremor deals 50 kinetic damage to any structure in contact with the ground in the area when you cast the power and at the start of each of your turns until the power ends. If a structure drops to 0 hit points, it collapses and potentially damages nearby creatures. A creature within half the distance of a structure&rsquo;s height must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5d6 kinetic damage, is knocked prone, and is buried in the rubble, requiring a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check as an action to escape. The GM can adjust the DC higher or lower, depending on the nature of the rubble. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and doesn&rsquo;t fall prone or become buried.</p>",

        "value": "<blockquote><p><i>\"She is ancient, and powerful, and dangerous. Very dangerous. But you're on to her now. She is never what she appears. Remember that.\"</i></p><p>- Mara Jade Skywalker</p></blockquote><p>Abeloth, also known as the Bringer of Chaos and Beloved Queen of the Stars, was a being very powerful in both the dark side of the Force and the light side of the Force because she drank from the Well of Power and bathed in the Pool of Knowledge. She first lived as the Servant, a mortal woman who served the powerful Ones on an unknown jungle planet over a hundred thousand years before the Battle of Yavin. Over the course of her life, she became the Mother: she kept the peace between the Father's warring Son and Daughter and became a loving part of the family. But she was still mortal—she grew old while her ageless family lived on—and she feared she would lose her precious family. In a desperate attempt to hold onto the life she so loved, she drank from the Font of Power and bathed in the Pool of Knowledge. Her actions corrupted her, transforming the Mother into the twisted, immortal entity known as Abeloth.</p><p>When the Father discovered her crime, he departed the planet with his children and left Abeloth stranded. The Son and the Daughter enlisted the help of the Killik hives from Alderaan, using them as workers to create massive technological artifacts, such as Centerpoint Station and Sinkhole Station to imprison Abeloth. According to the Killik Thuruht hive, Abeloth managed to escape her prison whenever the Current of the Force was altered and the flow of time changed. Each time she escaped, the Son and the Daughter would return to the Killiks and defeat Abeloth, locking her back in her prison. This cycle repeated itself for thousands of years, until the death of the Ones in 21 BBY.</p><p>When Jacen Solo fell to the dark side in 40 ABY and became the Sith Lord Darth Caedus in an attempt to change the future, he unintentionally awoke Abeloth. She later managed to escape from her prison due to the destruction of Centerpoint Station during Caedus' reign. Taking advantage of the chaos the galaxy was in, she immediately sought to maximize its effect, to totally wipe out civilization. However, she was discovered and hunted down by Luke Skywalker and his son, who constantly fought her and even destroyed some of her avatars. Ultimately Abeloth took the form of Senator Rokari Kem and successfully got herself elected as Chief of State of the Galactic Alliance. However, her remaining avatar bodies were killed and she was then destroyed by Luke Skywalker and Darth Krayt in the realm of Beyond shadows. Despite her death, Luke and the Jedi were not convinced Abeloth was dead for good and thus began searching for the planet Mortis. Luke intended to locate and obtain the same dagger used to kill The Ones decades earlier during his father's own encounter with them, to ensure that if Abeloth eventually returned, the Jedi would have a way to permanently kill her.</p><h3 style=\"font-family:&quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif\">Biography</h3><p><b>Imprisonment</b></p><blockquote><p><i>\"Once you were with me, here in the Maw. Once you were all with me. Now you are apart, but one by one, you are all awakening. And once awake, you can hear my call, and come to me.\"</i></p><p>- Abeloth</p></blockquote><p>The woman who would become Abeloth was first known as the Servant, a mortal who appeared through unknown means on the unknown jungle planet where the Ones lived around 100,000 BBY. She served the Father and his Son and Daughter, catering to their every need. But it was not long before the Servant became part of the Ones' family, filling the role of the Mother. The Mother kept the peace between the warring siblings and doted on the Father, ensuring the family's happiness for many years. Under her guidance, the Son began to use his destructive powers for something useful—he carved out caves and passages in the walls of the valley where they lived—and the siblings restored their home to its former glory, repairing the damage and neglect caused by the conflict of their rivalry.</p><p>But as the years went by, the Mother began to age while her family remained ageless. In her old age, she could no longer control the Son and Daughter's rivalry, and she began to fear that her family would abandon her. So in order to hold onto the life she had, the Mother decided to commit the Forbidden. While the Father was distracted by his warring children, she snuck a drink from the Font of Power just as the Son had done long ago. She then completed her transgression by bathing in the Pool of Knowledge like the Daughter, but the Father discovered her. But unlike the Ones, she was mortal, and so the Font and the Pool corrupted and twisted her. They granted her power, but twisted her mind and her body, creating the dark side entity known as Abeloth.</p><p>Abeloth used her new powers to dominate her adopted children, subduing them and forcing them to bow to her before the Font of Power. But at this point the Father, horrified and disappointed in Abeloth, stepped in. He departed the planet with his children, leaving Abeloth stranded alone and fulfilling her deepest fear—her family had abandoned her. This drove her to madness, fueling her desire to be loved and adored. Knowing that Abeloth would be a danger to others, the Son and the Daughter took control of the Killik hives from Alderaan and used them as workers. By joining the hivemind, the Ones shared their immense power in the Force with the Killiks. Under the direction of the siblings, the Killiks built many technological wonders, such as Centerpoint Station, Sinkhole Station, and many others. Using Centerpoint, the Ones crafted the spherical shell of black holes around their homeworld that would later become known as the Maw, and placed the smaller Sinkhole Station within to maintain the prison. After their creations were completed, the Son and the Daughter removed their power from the hives, and retreated with the Father to Mortis. Abeloth's former family would remain there until their deaths, only emerging to defeat Abeloth whenever she escaped from her prison.</p><p>The Killik Thuruht hive referred to Abeloth as the Bringer of Chaos, whose escapes and re-imprisonments formed a cycle of chaos and destruction that occurred whenever the Current of the Force—the flow of time— was altered. Abeloth thrived on fear and destruction, fanning the flames of conflict every time she escaped and sending the galaxy into chaos and turmoil. Each time she escaped, the Son and the Daughter would return to the Killiks and defeat Abeloth, locking her back in her prison. This cycle would repeat itself for hundreds of thousands of years, until the death of the Ones in 21 BBY. According to the Thuruht Histories, the Gree species came to her planet during one of her escapes to sacrifice an unknown saurian species to Abeloth.</p><p>Abeloth also existed beyond shadows, a realm that seemed to be a copy of Abeloth and the Ones' homeworld and which Force-sensitives could access by separating their minds from their bodies. Sinkhole Station would come to be inhabited by Mind Walkers, Force-sensitive beings whom she influenced with her powers. Desperate for contact with anyone, Abeloth would reach out to any Force-sensitives who entered the Maw (as the prison seemed to trap her powers within) and instill in them her overwhelming desire for companionship. These individuals would be inexplicably drawn to the Maw, where they would find Sinkhole Station and ascend to beyond shadows. Abeloth fed off of the Mind Walkers' life essences, absorbing their strength. Sometime prior to 44 ABY, the former Jedi Knight Callista Ming came across Abeloth, who consumed and killed her.</p><p>In 43.5 ABY, several Jedi Knights who had spent time at Shelter in the Maw during the Yuuzhan Vong War began to feel the effects of her influence, causing them to believe that everyone except for their fellow psychotic beings had been replaced by an impostor. The insane Jedi caused a rift between the Jedi Order and the Galactic Alliance government, as the two factions disagreed on how to deal with the issue. Abeloth also sent out a call through the Force, forcing Ship, a Sith Meditation Sphere, to travel to her planet in the Maw. Ship had spent the past two years forming a Sith armada for the Lost Tribe of Sith on the planet Kesh, and the Tribe thus sent a strike team to track down Ship and kill Jedi Grand Master Luke Skywalker—whose presence they had felt in the Force after he came into contact with an Aing-Tii relic, the Codex. Meanwhile, Skywalker and his son, Jedi Knight Ben Skywalker, were attempting to retrace the steps that Jedi Knight-turned-Sith Lord Jacen Solo had taken on his five-year journey after the Yuuzhan Vong War. The Skywalkers found the Mind Walkers and learned how to go beyond shadows, where Skywalker saw Abeloth in the Mists of Forgetfulness across the Lake of Apparitions. Referred to by the Mind Walkers as the \"Lady in the mists,\" Abeloth beckoned Skywalker to try to talk to her, but he refused.</p><p>Meanwhile, Ship, who was under Abeloth's complete control, led the Sith strike team to the planet which Abeloth inhabited. Abeloth took the form of a humanoid female of indetermined species and befriended the Sith strike team, claiming to be a refugee who had been stranded on the planet for the last thirty years. However, all the while she secretly sabotaged the Sith's efforts to escape. Abeloth had complete control over all of the planet's native flora, and she used them to attack the Sith, including the team's leader, Lady Olaris Rhea, who survived with the help of her apprentice, Vestara Khai. After the attack on Rhea, Khai was able to see Abeloth in her true form, just as the Skywalkers saw her beyond shadows—a woman with an overly large mouth, tiny sunken eyes, stubby arms, and hands with long, writhing tentacles instead of fingers. The rest of the strike team, however, still saw Abeloth as a normal humanoid female.</p><p><b>Battling Jedi and Sith</b></p><blockquote><p><i>\"Abeloth. Abeloth, I'm here.\"</i></p><p><i>\"So am I.\"</i></p><p>- Luke Skywalker and Abeloth</p></blockquote><p>After Abeloth encountered Skywalker beyond shadows, she allowed Ship to return to the Sith and transport them to Sinkhole Station to ambush the Skywalkers. Abeloth ordered the Sith to capture them rather than kill them, but Rhea later changed the mission's objective back to kill. The ambush, however, proved to be a failure—both Jedi escaped, and Khai was the only Sith survivor. Later, the Skywalkers speculated that Abeloth was the one causing the psychosis that afflicted Force-sensitives who had spent an extended amount of time in the Maw. Abeloth, meanwhile, continued to inflict her will upon more and more Jedi, in the hopes of luring those victims back to the Maw where she could consume their life energy.[3] Around that time, Ben also suggested that the Celestials might have built the Maw and the space station Centerpoint to contain Abeloth and her power; but once Centerpoint was destroyed, Sinkhole Station had begun to fall into disrepair and Abeloth's powers had grown.</p><p>A short time later, Abeloth managed to free herself from the containment of Sinkhole Station, destroying the station and killing the Mind Walkers. The Skywalkers, meanwhile, allied with a group of Sith from the Lost Tribe and ventured into the Maw to eliminate Abeloth. After finding Sinkhole Station destroyed, they traveled to Abeloth's planet. There, the Skywalkers' Force-sensitive friend Dyon Stadd, who had fallen prey to Abeloth's influence, was planted with a homing beacon and set free by Khai to find Abeloth. Stadd found her in a cave on the side of a volcano, and Abeloth entranced him before touching him and beginning to consume his life energy. However, she suddenly sensed the approach of the Jedi and Sith allies—who were tracking Stadd—and left him for dead, fleeing deeper into the cave. When her foes found her in a courtyard at the end of the cave, Abeloth took on Ming's appearance in an attempt to make Skywalker believe that she was, in fact, his long-lost lover. Skywalker eventually saw through her charade, however, realizing that Abeloth had actually consumed and killed Ming, and attacked her.</p><p>In the ensuing battle, the Sith betrayed the Jedi and created a control web, a trick they had learned from the dark side Nightsisters, in an attempt to capture Abeloth and force her to serve them, but she broke free and repulsed all of her assailants with a massive Force wave. She fled back up the cave and consumed and killed the Sith who had been left to stand guard with a recuperating Stadd, before turning to Stadd to finish consuming his life energy. However, her enemies had recovered from her attack and pursued her back up the cave, and Skywalker suddenly arrived on the scene. She took on the appearance of Stadd while projecting an image of Ming in an attempt to trick Skywalker, but he saw through it and stabbed his lightsaber into what appeared to be Stadd's chest. She morphed back into her true form, then, and prepared to unleash a wave of dark side energy, but appeared to die halfway through. All of the beings who had been affected by her influence were instantly freed, and the Skywalkers and three Sith—Khai, Khai's father, Gavar, and High Lord Sarasu Taalon—remained behind to investigate more into Abeloth. However, they soon discovered that she had somehow switched bodies with Stadd, and was thus not dead.</p><p><b>On the run</b></p><blockquote><p><i>\"Luke… Join with me. Save me…\"</i></p><p><i>\"I will. I will save you.\"</i></p><p>- Ming's presence within Abeloth and Luke Skywalker</p></blockquote><p>By the time the Sith and Jedi returned to the Skywalkers' ship, the Jade Shadow, Abeloth had already broken free from the vessel. She summoned Ship to return to the world, although the three Sith claimed to the Jedi that they were the ones to have called Ship back. Ship then convinced the Sith that they could find Abeloth by using the Force nexus known as the Pool of Knowledge, and took the five allies to find it. Abeloth, meanwhile, returned to the Jade Shadow and fled the planet. After seeing a vision in the Pool of a Jedi queen whom he believed could stop the Sith invasion, Taalon jumped into the Pool and a duel broke out between the Jedi and Sith. The Jedi escaped, and, following his immersion in the Pool, Taalon began to slowly transform into the same kind of entity as Abeloth.</p><p>Abeloth, meanwhile, traveled to the pacifistic Force-sensitive Fallanassi on the moon Pydyr and took over the body of their leader, Akanah Norand Goss Pell. The Jedi, accompanied by Vestara Khai—whom they allowed to accompany them despite the fact that they knew she was working as a spy for her Tribe—tracked Abeloth to Pydyr. Khai sent out a message to the Sith fleet, and the Sith sent shuttles of reinforcements, including Taalon and Gavar Khai. They agreed to work once more with the Jedi, and Luke Skywalker led the tenuous allies to the Fallanassi village where Abeloth was hiding. After they broke through Abeloth's defenses of illusions in the White Current, she came to meet them in the form of Pell. Taalon began to interrogate her about Abeloth, and she revealed that she had come to Pydyr because she was a Fallanassi. However, when she refused to answer Luke Skywalker's question of whether that meant Abeloth had always been Fallanassi, or whether she had only recently joined, Taalon ordered Gavar to kill one of the Fallanassi. In response, Abeloth used the White Current to induce visions that drove all of the Sith—save Khai and Taalon—insane, giving up her cover. She then took Taalon into a gathering hall in the Fallanassi village to speak with him, but the Jedi and Vestara followed.</p><p>Luke Skywalker engaged Abeloth in battle once more, and he again defeated her, killing Pell's body. However, Abeloth deserted that body and returned soon after in the form of Callista Ming. She incapacitated Skywalker, while Taalon—who desired to learn from Abeloth what exactly he was becoming—captured Ben in a Force net. As Taalon and Abeloth conversed, Abeloth revealed that she knew he could not eat mortal food, and then began to feed him dark energy from her tentacles. However, Luke returned to consciousness and brought the ceiling of the hall they were in down upon them, distracting Abeloth while Vestara Khai stepped forward and killed Taalon to prevent him from becoming another being like Abeloth. In the ensuing fight, Abeloth was severely injured by the Jedi, and she fled in Ship, escaping the system. The Skywalkers, now with Khai as their ally, were reinforced by a flight of Jedi in StealthXs sent from Coruscant, who helped them fight off the remaining Sith so that they could continue to hunt her down.</p><p>Abeloth stopped first at Meliflar Station, where she forcibly imbued the girl Fala with some of her own energy to use her as bait, and forced the space station's crew to set up an ambush for the Skywalkers, so that when they arrived the Jade Shadow would be destroyed instantly. Abeloth then continued on to the planet Nam Chorios. Her planned ambush for the Jedi failed, however, as the station's inhabitants decided instead to try and capture the vessel. Meanwhile, on Nam Chorios, Abeloth recovered and gained control of the Theran Listeners by consuming and possessing their leader, Nenn. As her influence over the Theran Listeners steadily grew stronger, Jedi Knights Valin and Jysella Horn—two of the first Knights of the New Jedi Order to fall prey to her influence—were drawn by her to the world.</p><p>However, Khai and the Skywalkers eventually caught up to Abeloth in the pumping station in the city of Crystal Valley. There, Abeloth again appeared to them in the form of Callista in an yet another attempt to sway Luke Skywalker to join with her. However, in doing so she revealed that Callista's spirit was more intact than those of the other beings she had consumed, and thus had more influence over her. Luke allowed Callista's spirit to engage him with her mind and with the Force, expanding both of their Force presences as they relived her memories of the past; he felt her love for him, as well as the pain and loneliness she felt after being consumed by Abeloth. Meanwhile, a strike team of Sith led by Saber Tola Annax arrived and began battling Abeloth as well. Abeloth tried to hide her presence behind Callista, hoping to make it appear that the being confronting Luke was Callista herself—but Luke again saw through her disguise. He used the mnemotherapy technique he had learned from the Listeners to tear Callista's spirit away from Abeloth, saving her and weakening Abeloth greatly in the process. As Callista's spirit, finally freed, faded into the Force, Abeloth reverted to using the body of Nenn. However, the Listener-Master refused to be controlled by her and stabbed himself with a lightsaber, further weakening Abeloth. Horn, who had been in combat with Ben and Khai, was knocked unconscious.</p><p><b>Rise to power</b></p><blockquote><p><i>\"Nothing can hold her… Fool to think I could use her… What is she?… By the dark, the greatest mistake I have ever made…\"</i></p><p>- Darish Vol, on Abeloth</p></blockquote><p>While the Sith and Jedi battled each other, Abeloth attempted to flee in Ship. However, a Jedi fleet was already in orbit, battling a Sith flotilla under the command of Gavar Khai. Luke joined the Jedi in fighter combat in the pursuit of Ship, who was heavily damaged and weakened. Ship suffered multiple hits, but managed to escape with Abeloth alive. Abeloth soon afterward contacted Gavar Khai, whose fleet was regrouping after their defeat. She told him that the Jedi, their mutual enemy, were too powerful for either of them to overcome separately,[6] and they discussed an alliance. He then took Abeloth to the Tribe's homeworld, Kesh, where a meeting of the Tribe was called by Grand Lord Darish Vol. Vol decided to accept the alliance, and Abeloth was brought to the surface for a large celebration.</p><p>That evening, however, Abeloth appeared to Vol in his sleep and attempted to kill him. He allowed her into his mind, and she was too reckless in her approach, letting him in turn enter her mind. He discovered the pain of her loneliness and her need for adoration, and dueled her mentally, telling her that she was unloved. Abeloth's assassination attempt turned into an attempt to fight free from Vol's grasp, and she finally broke free. Infuriated and in agony, Abeloth unleashed waves of dark side power onto the Sith capital city of Tahv, killing thousands and leaving the city in ruins. As she fled in Ship, she used the mental hold she had begun to develop over several of the Sith to influence them to defect from the Tribe's armada and join her. Leading those forces was Gavar Khai in the ChaseMaster frigate Black Wave. They successfully escaped Kesh, and upon their rendezvous, Abeloth ordered Khai to lead the Jedi and Sith who would inevitably attempt to find her astray.</p><p>As Vestara Khai and the Skywalkers continued to hunt for Abeloth, she took the form of the Jessar Rokari Kem, a highly popular resistance leader who was due to become a Senator in the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances. When Gavar Khai and a team of nine other Sabers were killed by Abeloth's pursuers, she granted command of the Black Wave to Saber Tola Annax. However, she soon afterward stripped Annax of her powers, filled her with dark energy and left her as bait on the planet Upekzar, where she laid a trap for the Jedi. Meanwhile, in the guise of Kem, Abeloth traveled to the galactic capital Coruscant, where she found that several Sith, including High Lord Ivaar Workan, had already infiltrated the Galactic Alliance government.</p><p>Without revealing her true identity as Abeloth, she then threatened Workan—who was masquerading as Senator Kameron Suldar—to stay out of her way, and suggested that she knew his secret. Meanwhile, the Jedi Order left all operations on Coruscant under the pretense of needing to distance itself from the Galactic Alliance and act as its own authority, rather than as an official branch of the government—however, unbeknownst to Abeloth and the Sith, Luke Skywalker knew of the Sith's infiltration and was hoping to lure the Sith into making a move on Coruscant. Soon afterward, Vol arrived on Coruscant and attempted to assassinate Kem—Workan had told him that Kem was the only thing standing in the way of the Sith taking control of the government. However, Abeloth defeated Vol and subsequently called Workan, showing him Vol's decapitated head and ordering that he meet with her the next day.</p><p>Still in Kem's guise, Abeloth met with Workan and ordered that he initiate a vote to replace the current interim Chief of State, Padnel Ovin, with herself, and then help her achieve the title of \"Beloved Queen of the Stars\" and then goddess. During the Senate session, Workan called for the vote, but Ovin came forward to make a speech—unbeknownst to Abeloth and the Sith, he was stalling to give his Chief of Staff, Wynn Dorvan, time to assist in the rescue of Jedi Leia Organa Solo, whose arrest Workan had arranged. Abeloth finally grew tired of Ovin's speech and caused him to collapse; he was soon after pronounced dead. Workan then insisted that the vote be held immediately, and with the help of the Force to influence some of the Senators, Kem won with four-fifths of the Senate's vote, thus making Abeloth Chief of State. Abeloth subsequently came to see Dorvan, who had been captured by three Sith, and shed her disguise as Kem to reveal her true form to him, to his horror.</p><p><b>\"Death\"</b></p><p>Abeloth's reign eventually came to an end with the Liberation of Coruscant. Using Dorvan as her aide, she solidified her rule on the planet until the Jedi began striking at the Lost Tribe across the planet. Under Dorvan's advice, the Sith retreated into the Jedi Temple. Realizing that the Sith would be unable to maintain their hold on Coruscant, and also seeing the opportunity to recreate her family, she abducted Vestara Khai and Ben Skywalker.</p><p>To distract the Jedi, Abeloth caused cataclysmic seismic activities on Coruscant, ensuring the potential death of billions if they gave chase to her. Abeloth's Korelei-avatar brought Vestara and Ben to her planet with the intention of forcing them to drink from the Font of Power, which would transform them into - for lack of a better name - the new family of Ones who would reshape the galaxy to their liking. She also sent out Ship to attack Luke Skywalker, anticipating that he would attempt to stop her. Abeloth then mindwalked the majority of her essence into the Realm Beyond Shadows to duel with Luke Skywalker, as well as Darth Krayt, a Sith Lord that was not affiliated with the Lost Tribe of the Sith. It was a grueling duel, although they eventually succeeded when Abeloth's avatar bodies were being destroyed one-by-one across the galaxy, eventually sinking into the Lake of Apparitions afterwards. Although Abeloth was dead, the Jedi Order knew that she would end up returning sometime (after becoming strong enough to do so), with Luke knowing that such a Force entity couldn't be \"truly\" killed. According to Luke, Abeloth might not even return during his and the other Masters' lifetime, but even a hundred years or a hundred thousand years later. As a precautionary measure, the Jedi intended to locate the Mortis Monolith in order to obtain the Mortis Dagger, ensuring they would have a way to kill Abeloth for good if she were to return.</p><h3 style=\"font-family:&quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif\"><b>Personality and traits</b></h3><blockquote><p><i>\"Silly Jedi. No one can explain Abeloth.\"</i></p><p>- Akanah</p></blockquote><p>Abeloth was a being created as a servant by the three Celestials: the Father, the Daughter, and the Son.</p><p>She was antagonized by loneliness; she felt an absolute need to be loved and adored, and was nearly overcome when Vol attacked her with the idea that she was hideous and despised. She fed her craving for adulation by instilling in Force-sensitives a desire to be with her, and in turn catered to their every need and assumed the role as their mother. This stemmed from her original fear of losing her family, who remained ageless while she became old and decrepit. In an attempt to hold on to the life she had, Abeloth drank from the Font of Power and bathed in the Pool of Knowledge, which corrupted her mind and twisted her love for her family into a craving for companionship. When her family abandoned her on their planet—the very reason she committed her crimes in the first place— she was driven insane by loneliness and despair. She fed on fear and destruction in an attempt to gain more power, as her ultimate goal was to recreate her lost family—she tried to force Ben Skywalker and Vestara Khai to drink from the Font of Power, intending them to be the replacements for the Son and Daughter.</p><p>Abeloth had the ability to change her appearance at will, often taking on the appearance of Callista Ming, whom she had consumed. However, Abeloth's true form was that of a humanoid and barely-female being with deeply-sunken black eye sockets and tiny silver eyes reminiscent of tiny stars at the bottom of a deep well. She had a long cascade of straw-like, honey-blond hair that reached to the ground and a large, full-lipped mouth that stretched from ear-to-ear and contained needle-like teeth. Her arms were stubby, protruding no more than ten centimeters from her shoulders, with hands that had long, writhing tentacles for fingers with suction cup tips. Her body was rigid and straight, and when she walked or ran, her legs rippled forward more than they swung. In addition, her body was enshrouded in mist, giving her an ethereal aspect to her already frightening appearance.</p><h3 style=\"font-family:&quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif\">Powers and abilities</h3><blockquote><p><i>\"I am programmed to obey a strong will. The girl is strong. You are stronger, Sword of the Jedi. But neither of you can break the hold she has on me. She is older, and more powerful than you can possibly imagine.\"</i></p><p>- Ship, to Jaina Solo</p></blockquote><p>While Abeloth appeared as a humanoid female of indeterminate species to most, Luke Skywalker saw her true form beyond shadows and Vestara Khai was able to see her true appearance after Khai discovered Abeloth's treachery against the Sith. Abeloth could command the native flora of her planet to do her bidding and also had the ability to influence the minds of Force-sensitive beings who had spent an extended period of time in the Maw, causing in them a psychosis which made them believe that everyone—except for other such psychotic beings—had been replaced by impostors and instilling in them a desire to find her. Once the influenced being found her, she consumed their life energy, killing them and making herself stronger. The strength of her influence was formidable—even when the Jedi learned what symptoms to look for, upon the onset of the psychosis they still believed that everyone they knew was an impostor. She was also able to control the Meditation Sphere Ship which was programmed to obey the strongest will; her powers overwhelming those of the Sith's and of the Jedi's attempts to control the Sphere. Described by Tahiri Veila as a living Force volcano, Abeloth's strength in the Force was a dozen times that of Luke Skywalker, who was widely recognized as the most powerful Force user in the galaxy. However, Skywalker was able to defeat her despite this.</p><p>Abeloth wielded exceptional telekinetic powers, using the Force to blast everyone away from her during her battle with the Sith and Jedi. She was able to resist the powers of a control web, and was also able to teleport herself from one place to another, a power which she also used during her battle with the Sith and Jedi. Abeloth was able to take on the physical appearances of beings that she had consumed, including Callista Ming and Dyon Stadd, and she was also able to project images of other beings, as she did when projecting an image of Callista while she herself took on the form of Stadd in an attempt to trick Luke Skywalker. Abeloth was able to redirect Vestara Khai's Force lightning back at her. She was also more than capable of using Force lightning herself, using it in multiple fights with the Sith and Luke Skywalker. Abeloth's sheer strength was extensive—after her mental duel with Vol, she released waves of Force energy on Tahv that caused the beings in her vicinity to implode, those farther away to be ripped to pieces, the buildings to melt to the ground, and glass and weaponry to fly through the city, looking for someone to hurt so that they could feel the pain she felt. Abeloth was capable of producing a Force-flash that could affect the visuals of ships in an entire star system. She was known to feed on fear and death. She was also capable of using the Fold space ability.</p><p>Abeloth was also able to possess or switch bodies—before Skywalker could kill her, she switched bodies with Stadd and took on Stadd's appearance, tricking the Jedi and Sith for several days into believing that she was dead. Later, she took over the body of the Fallanassi Akanah Norand Goss Pell, although Pell fought back. When she was again defeated by Skywalker, she left Pell's body and returned in the form of Callista soon after, and told Skywalker that she had more bodies than he could destroy. She was also capable of absorbing the consciousness of beings in order to further enhance her power, as Callista Ming's mind dwelled within Abeloth. However, Luke was able to use mnemotherapy to rip Callista Ming's soul free from Abeloth and allow her to rest in peace, severely weakening Abeloth in the process. She was later able to use her abilities to impersonate Rokari Kem and gain prominence on Coruscant. When Vol attempted to assassinate Kem, she beheaded the Grand Lord and forced High Lord Ivaar Workan to aide her in becoming Chief of State of the Galactic Alliance. Later, she also possessed Imperial Officer Lydea Pagorski, as part of a plan to help Natasi Daala gain power in the Imperial Remnant for her own purposes. However, her dependency on avatars was ultimately her greatest weakness: killing a significant amount of avatar bodies in her possession also resulting in her strength weakening rapidly to the point of death, which Luke ultimately utilized to deliver the finishing blow on Abeloth in their duel. Also, she preferred to inhabit the bodies of Force-sensitives, as non Force-sensitives' bodies failed to last for long before deteriorating.</p>",
