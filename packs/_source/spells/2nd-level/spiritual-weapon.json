When you cast the power, you can make a melee power attack against a creature within 5 feet of the weapon. On a hit, the target takes force damage equal to 1d8 + your powercasting ability modifier.</p><p>As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the weapon up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 5 feet of it.</p><p>The weapon can take whatever form you choose. Clerics of deities who are associated with a particular weapon (as St. Cuthbert is known for his mace and Thor for his hammer) make this power's effect resemble that weapon.</p><p><strong>Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this power using a power slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for every two slot levels above the 2nd.</p>",
