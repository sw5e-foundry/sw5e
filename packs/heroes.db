your powerbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other powers during your adventures. You could discover a power recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p><p><em><strong>Copying a Power into the Book.</strong></em> When you find a wizard power of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your powerbook if it is of a power level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p><p>Copying that power into your powerbook involves reproducing the basic form of the power, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the power until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your powerbook using your own notation.</p><p>For each level of the power, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the power to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the power just like your other powers.</p><p><em><strong>Replacing the Book.</strong></em> You can copy a power from your own powerbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your powerbook. This is just like copying a new power into your powerbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the power. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied power.</p><p>If you lose your powerbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the powers that you have prepared into a new powerbook. Filling out the remainder of your powerbook requires you to find new powers to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup powerbooks in a safe place.</p><p><em><strong>The Book's Appearance.</strong></em> Your powerbook is a unique compilation of powers, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous powerbook in a mishap.</p><h1>Arcane Traditions</h1><p>The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.</p><p>The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of powers, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the powers of each school require mastery of different techniques.</p><p>@Compendium[sw5e.archetypes.Ye5f3FReEnuXfi0y]{School of Evocation}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":{"custom":"","book":"SRD

power.</p>\n<h5>At-Wills</h5>\n<p>At 1st level, you know three at-wills of your choice from the wizard power list. You learn additional wizard at-wills of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the At-Wills Known column of the Wizard table.</p>\n<h5>Powerbook</h5>\n<p>At 1st level, you have a powerbook containing six 1stlevel wizard powers of your choice. Your powerbook is the repository of the wizard powers you know, except your at-wills, which are fixed in your mind.</p>\n<h5>Preparing and Casting Powers</h5>\n<p>The Wizard table shows how many power slots you have to cast your powers of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these powers, you must expend a slot of the power's level or higher. You regain all expended power slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p>You prepare the list of wizard powers that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard powers from your powerbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one power). The powers must be of a level for which you have power slots.</p>\n<p>For example, if you're a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level power slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared powers can include six powers of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your powerbook. If you prepare the 1st-level power magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the power doesn't remove it from your list of prepared powers.</p>\n<p>You can change your list of prepared powers when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard powers requires time spent studying your powerbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the power: at least 1 minute per power level for each power on your list.</p>\n<h5>Powercasting Ability</h5>\n<p>Intelligence is your powercasting ability for your wizard powers, since you learn your powers through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a power refers to your powercasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p><strong>Power save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\n<p><strong>Power attack modifier </strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\n<h5>Ritual Casting</h5>\n<p>You can cast a wizard power as a ritual if that power has the ritual tag and you have the power in your powerbook. You don't need to have the power prepared.</p>\n<h5>Powercasting Focus</h5>\n<p>You can use an arcane focus as a powercasting focus for your wizard powers.</p>\n<h5>Learning Powers of 1st Level and Higher</h5>\n<p>Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard powers of your choice to your powerbook for free. Each of these powers must be of a level for which you have power slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other powers that you can add to your powerbook (see the \"Your Powerbook\" sidebar).</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":{"custom":"","book":"SRD 5.1","page":"","license":"CC-BY-4.0"},"activation":{"type":"","cost":null,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":"","units":""},"cover":null,"crewed":false,"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":"","prompt":true},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":null,"recovery":"","prompt":true},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null,"scale":false},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":"","chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"power"},"type":{"value":"class","subtype":""},"requirements":"Wizard 1","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"flags":{"sw5e":{"sourceId":"Compendium.sw5e.classfeatures.gbNo5eVPaqr8IVKL","advancementOrigin":"N4bhi6usK8wuNEnh.NhwTsEnDKEFARuzC"}},"img":"icons/magic/fire/explosion-embers-orange.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"_stats":{"systemId":"sw5e","systemVersion":"2.4.0","coreVersion":"10.303","createdTime":1661787234406,"modifiedTime":1699987548856,"lastModifiedBy":"sw5ebuilder0000"}},{"_id":"fnxa7jBxIHkDyZuU","name":"Arcane Recovery","ownership":{"default":0},"type":"feat","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your powerbook.

paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin's training. Some characters with this class don't consider themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin's heart.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[sw5e.archetypes.sZ86mbX8D5PfYuhl]{Oath of Devotion}</p>\n<h3>Breaking Your Oath</h3>\n<p>A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath.</p>\n<p>A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an allnight vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh.</p>\n<p>If a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the GM's discretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":{"custom":"","book":"SRD 5.1","page":"","license":"CC-BY-4.0"},"identifier":"paladin","levels":1,"hitDice":"d10","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{"1":"max"},"title":"Hit Points","icon":"systems/sw5e/icons/svg/hit-points.svg","_id":"FiGiRPSjIr96LxZo"},{"type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.sw5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","Compendium.sw5e.classfeatures.OdrvL3afwLOPeuYZ"],"optional":false,"power":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{"added":{"BudM4uxDSnRehek7":"Compendium.sw5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","2zb2FwOFtktH9JHF":"Compendium.sw5e.classfeatures.OdrvL3afwLOPeuYZ"}},"level":1,"title":"Features","icon":"systems/sw5e/icons/svg/item-grant.svg","_id":"RFgaDXztbtJFtTZ1"},{"type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.sw5e.classfeatures.Ho7dVxBlOYFlfBHk","Compendium.sw5e.classfeatures.ihoQHsmVZlyDbPhX","Compendium.sw5e.classfeatures.ySMPQ6zNSlvkrl2f"],"optional":false,"power":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":2,"title":"Features","icon":"systems/sw5e/icons/svg/item-grant.svg","_id":"JP26UvG5IiFmEBbH"},{"type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.sw5e.classfeatures.dY9yrqkyEDuF0CG2","Compendium.sw5e.classfeatures.olAqNsUTIef9x8xC","Compendium.sw5e.classfeatures.8M7uOPhbTxoxxJSo"],"optional":false,"power":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":3,"title":"Features","icon":"systems/sw5e/icons/svg/item-grant.svg","_id":"H7qZzx7uWwpFp4BO"},{"type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.sw5e.classfeatures.XogoBnFWmCAHXppo"],"optional":false,"power":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":5,"title":"Features","icon":"systems/sw5e/icons/svg/item-grant.svg","_id":"143iuO07gsV0GF3t"},{"type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.sw5e.classfeatures.carGDhkIdoduTC0I"],"optional":false,"power":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":6,"title":"Features","icon":"systems/sw5e/icons/svg/item-grant.svg","_id":"NB5hjQasB1g8zM4U"},{"type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.sw5e.classfeatures.nahSkBO6LH4HkpaT"],"optional":false,"power":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":10,"title":"Features","icon":"systems/sw5e/icons/svg/item-grant.svg","_id":"CQvgRRVuvnszH9nK"},{"type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.sw5e.classfeatures.FAk41RPCTcvCk6KI"],"optional":false,"power":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":11,"title":"Features","icon":"systems/sw5e/icons/svg/item-grant.svg","_id":"EdDaJR59eAVkAssZ"},{"type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.sw5e.classfeatures.U7BIPVPsptBmwsnV"],"optional":false,"power":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":14,"title":"Features","icon":"systems/sw5e/icons/svg/item-grant.svg","_id":"sD79rzcMobOKOeCN"},{"type":"ItemChoice","configuration":{"hint":"Choose one of the following options.

Boon</h3><p>Each Pact Boon option produces a special creature or an object that reflects your patron's nature.</p><p><em><strong>Pact of the Chain. </strong></em>Your familiar is more cunning than a typical familiar. Its default form can be a reflection of your patron, with imps and quasits tied to the Fiend.</p><p><em><strong>Pact of the Blade. </strong></em>If you serve the Fiend, your weapon could be an axe made of black metal and adorned with decorative flames.</p><p><em><strong>Pact of the Tome. </strong></em>Your Book of Shadows could be a weighty tome bound in demon hide studded with iron, holding powers of conjuration and a wealth of forbidden lore about the sinister regions of the cosmos, a gift of the Fiend.</p><hr /><h1>Otherworldly Patrons</h1><p>The beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are mighty inhabitants of other planes of existence—not gods, but almost godlike in their power. Various patrons give their warlocks access to different powers and invocations, and expect significant favors in return.</p><p>Some patrons collect warlocks, doling out mystic knowledge relatively freely or boasting of their ability to bind mortals to their will. Other patrons bestow their power only grudgingly, and might make a pact with only one warlock. Warlocks who serve the same patron might view each other as allies, siblings, or rivals.</p><p>@Compendium[sw5e.archetypes.WPFVBg589uI8iOMH]{The Fiend}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":{"custom":"","book":"SRD 5.1","page":"","license":"CC-BY-4.0"},"identifier":"warlock","levels":1,"hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{"1":"max"},"title":"Hit Points","icon":"systems/sw5e/icons/svg/hit-points.svg","_id":"m04qS9GheCqdni2h"},{"type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.sw5e.classfeatures.jTXHaK0vvT5DV3uO","Compendium.sw5e.classfeatures.x6IJZwr6f0SGral7"],"optional":false,"power":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{"added":{"O5nhueIb5HIil0eh":"Compendium.sw5e.classfeatures.jTXHaK0vvT5DV3uO","uf6mKJJICzDHiWly":"Compendium.sw5e.classfeatures.x6IJZwr6f0SGral7"}},"level":1,"title":"Features","icon":"systems/sw5e/icons/svg/item-grant.svg","_id":"AXY5iebZXk6dv5cn"},{"type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.sw5e.classfeatures.8MlxM2nEfE3Q0EVk"],"optional":false,"power":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":2,"title":"Features","icon":"systems/sw5e/icons/svg/item-grant.svg","_id":"5FXyMXNNqax59haT"},{"type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.sw5e.classfeatures.QwgfIpCN8VWfoUtX"],"optional":false,"power":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":3,"title":"Features","icon":"systems/sw5e/icons/svg/item-grant.svg","_id":"OuBVlt2PDTT7vBoB"},{"type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.sw5e.classfeatures.zB77V8BcCJvWVxck"],"optional":false,"power":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":11,"title":"Features","icon":"systems/sw5e/icons/svg/item-grant.svg","_id":"Ah54Qpu2mLCMZNay"},{"type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.sw5e.classfeatures.0C04rwyvoknvFYiy"],"optional":false,"power":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":20,"title":"Features","icon":"systems/sw5e/icons/svg/item-grant.svg","_id":"sKx7KLPkzjGf2sA1"},{"type":"ItemChoice","configuration":{"hint":"If an eldritch invocation has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn it.

plants to be sacred, particularly alder, ash, birch, elder, hazel, holly, juniper, mistletoe, oak, rowan, willow, and yew. Druids often use such plants as part of a powercasting focus, incorporating lengths of oak or yew or sprigs of mistletoe.</p><p>Similarly, a druid uses such woods to make other objects, such as weapons and shields. Yew is associated with death and rebirth, so weapon handles for scimitars or sickles might be fashioned from it. Ash is associated with life and oak with strength. These woods make excellent hafts or whole weapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as well as shields. Alder is associated with air, and it might be used for thrown weapons, such as darts or javelins.</p><p>Druids from regions that lack the plants described here have chosen other plants to take on similar uses. For instance, a druid of a desert region might value the yucca tree and cactus plants.</p><h3>Druids and the Gods</h3><p>Some druids venerate the forces of nature themselves, but most druids are devoted to one of the many nature deities worshiped in the multiverse (the lists of gods in @UUID[Compendium.sw5e.rules.udVPA9JW5wy5t3G5]{Appendix B} include many such deities). The worship of these deities is often considered a more ancient tradition than the faiths of clerics and urbanized peoples.</p><h1>Druid

You learn additional druid at-wills of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the At-Wills Known column of the Druid table.</p>\n<h5>Preparing and Casting Powers</h5>\n<p>The Druid table shows how many power slots you have to cast your powers of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid powers, you must expend a slot of the power's level or higher. You regain all expended power slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p>You prepare the list of druid powers that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid power list. When you do so, choose a number of druid powers equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one power). The powers must be of a level for which you have power slots.</p>\n<p>For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level power slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared powers can include six powers of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level power cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the power doesn't remove it from your list of prepared powers.</p>\n<p>You can also change your list of prepared powers when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid powers requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per power level for each power on your list.</p>\n<h5>Powercasting Ability</h5>\n<p>Wisdom is your powercasting ability for your druid powers, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a power refers to your powercasting ability.
