      "value": "<p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a powerbook containing powers that show the first glimmerings of your true power.</p>\n<h5>At-Wills</h5>\n<p>At 1st level, you know three at-wills of your choice from the wizard power list. You learn additional wizard at-wills of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the At-Wills Known column of the Wizard table.</p>\n<h5>Powerbook</h5>\n<p>At 1st level, you have a powerbook containing six 1stlevel wizard powers of your choice. Your powerbook is the repository of the wizard powers you know, except your at-wills, which are fixed in your mind.</p>\n<h5>Preparing and Casting Powers</h5>\n<p>The Wizard table shows how many power slots you have to cast your powers of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these powers, you must expend a slot of the power's level or higher. You regain all expended power slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p>You prepare the list of wizard powers that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard powers from your powerbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one power). The powers must be of a level for which you have power slots.</p>\n<p>For example, if you're a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level power slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared powers can include six powers of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your powerbook. If you prepare the 1st-level power magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the power doesn't remove it from your list of prepared powers.</p>\n<p>You can change your list of prepared powers when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard powers requires time spent studying your powerbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the power: at least 1 minute per power level for each power on your list.</p>\n<h5>Powercasting Ability</h5>\n<p>Intelligence is your powercasting ability for your wizard powers, since you learn your powers through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a power refers to your powercasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p><strong>Power save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\n<p><strong>Power attack modifier </strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\n<h5>Ritual Casting</h5>\n<p>You can cast a wizard power as a ritual if that power has the ritual tag and you have the power in your powerbook. You don't need to have the power prepared.</p>\n<h5>Powercasting Focus</h5>\n<p>You can use an arcane focus as a powercasting focus for your wizard powers.</p>\n<h5>Learning Powers of 1st Level and Higher</h5>\n<p>Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard powers of your choice to your powerbook for free. Each of these powers must be of a level for which you have power slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other powers that you can add to your powerbook (see the \"Your Powerbook\" sidebar).</p>",
