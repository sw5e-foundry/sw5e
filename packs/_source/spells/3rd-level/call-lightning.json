      "value": "<p>A storm cloud appears in the shape of a cylinder that is 10 feet tall with a 60-foot radius, centered on a point you can see 100 feet directly above you. The power fails if you can't see a point in the air where the storm cloud could appear (for example, if you are in a room that can't accommodate the cloud).</p><p>When you cast the power, choose a point you can see within range. A bolt of lightning flashes down from the cloud to that point. Each creature within 5 feet of that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d10 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On each of your turns until the power ends, you can use your action to call down lightning in this way again, targeting the same point or a different one.</p><p>If you are outdoors in stormy conditions when you cast this power, the power gives you control over the existing storm instead of creating a new one. Under such conditions, the power's damage increases by 1d10.</p><p><strong>Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this power using a power slot of 4th or higher level, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 3rd.</p>",
