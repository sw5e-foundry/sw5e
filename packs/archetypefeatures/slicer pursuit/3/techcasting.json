      "value": "<p><em><strong>Slicer Pursuit:</strong> 3rd level</em></p>\n<p>You have derived powers from schematics with the aid of your wristpad. See chapter 10 for the general rules of techcasting and chapter 12 for the tech powers list.</p>\n<h3>Tech Powers Known</h3>\n<p>You learn 3 tech powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Tech Powers Known column of the Slicer Pursuit Techcasting table. You may not learn a tech power of a level higher than your Max Power Level.</p>\n<h3>Tech Points</h3>\n<p>You have a number of tech points equal to half of your scholar level, as shown in the Tech Points column of the Slicer Pursuit Techcasting table, + your Intelligence modifier. You use these tech points to cast tech powers. You regain all expended tech points when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<h3>Max Power Level</h3>\n<p>Many tech powers can be overcharged, consuming more tech points to create a greater effect. You can overcharge these powers to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the Slicer Pursuit Techcasting table.</p>\n<p>You may only cast tech powers at 4th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.</p>\n<h3>Techcasting Ability</h3>\n<p>Intelligence is your techcasting ability for your tech powers. You use your Intelligence whenever a power refers to your techcasting ability. Additionally, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a tech power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p><em></em>_</p>\n<p><strong>Tech save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\n<p><em></em>_</p>\n<p><strong>Tech attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\n<p><em></em>_</p>\n<h3>Techcasting Focus</h3>\n<p>You use a wristpad (found in chapter 5 of the Player's Handbook) as a tech focus for your tech powers.</p>",
