      "value": "<h2>Biology and Appearence</h2>\n<p>Due to Dorin having a unique atmosphere composed of helium and a gas unique to their world, the kel dors are forced to wear an antiox breath mask and protective goggles whenever in atmospheres of a different composition. Without their protective goggles, kel dors were considered effectively blind when away from Dorin. They were also able to survive in the vacuum of space for a short time, though it was unknown exactly how long they could withstand it.</p>\n<p>The kel dors also have heightened reflexes, a result of the extrasensory organs in their heads. They are typically quick and wise. </p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Kel dors are noted for their simple approach to justice, and they typically see moral issues in black and white. On the one hand, the kel dor are noted for their hospitality; they would never turn away a stranger in need. Yet, kel dors are not averse to taking the law into their own hands, and have no compunctions about putting to death a thief who was merely stealing to feed himself.</p>\n<p>Kel dor Force-sensitives are often trained as Baran Do Sages, who have an honored place in kel dor culture. They often serve as advisers to rich and powerful kel dor families. Wars and disasters have been averted simply by the insight of a Baran Do Sage.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Kel dor names are base on sound generated by Dorin's unique atmosphere. Surnames are based on ancient family trades.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Bil, I'zers, Nullo, Taciss, Zaln</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Arri'ku, Bhi're, Chu, So'ro, Thirza</p>\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> Andugai, Borak, Haimnech, Vitchess</p>",
