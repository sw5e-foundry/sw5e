      "value": "<p><em><strong>Exhibition Specialist:</strong> 18th level</em></p>\n<p>You've perfected a fighting style that allows you to stylishly dominate the field of battle. When you mark a creature with your In The Spotlight feature, you can enhance it. For the duration of the mark, you gain the following additional benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can add your full Charisma modifier, instead of half, to any weapon damage roll you make against the marked target that doesn't already include that modifier.</li>\n<li>You can add half your Charisma modifier (minimum of one) to any weapon attack roll you make against the marked target that doesn't already include that modifier.</li>\n<li>If the marked target is reduced to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to mark a new creature within 30 feet of you. The duration of the new mark is equal to the remaining duration of the existing mark.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This effect ends early if you're incapacitated or die. Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>",
