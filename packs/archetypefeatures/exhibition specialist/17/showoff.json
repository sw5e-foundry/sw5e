      "value": "<p><em><strong>Exhibition Specialist:</strong> 3rd, 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level</em></p>\n<p>You're a master at dazzling your friends and enemies alike. When you would make a Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, or Charisma  check, you can roll a [[/r d4]] and add it to the roll. On a success, you can immediately choose a number of creatures within 30 feet of you that can see you up to your Charisma modifier (no action required, minimum of one). Each creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be charmed by you. This effects ends on a target after 1 minute, if it takes any damage, if you attack it, or if it witnesses you attacking or damaging any of its allies. If a target succeeds on this saving throw, the target has no hint you tried to charm it.</p>\n<p>This die increases to [[/r 1d6]] at 5th level, [[/r 1d8]] at 9th level, [[/r 1d10]] at 13th level, and [[/r 1d12]] at 17th level.</p>\n<p>Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p>",
