      "value": "<p><em><strong>Scrapper Practice:</strong> 3rd level</em></p>\n<p>You learn to use underhanded tactics to gain the upper hand. When you deal Sneak Attack damage to a creature, you may choose to forgo two of your Sneak Attack Dice in order to perform an upper hand technique.</p>\n<p>Some of your upper hand techniques require your target to make a saving throw to resist the technique's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: </p>\n<p><em></em>_</p>\n<p><strong>Upper Hand save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>\n<p><em></em>_</p>\n<h3>Brutal Hit</h3>\n<p>You attempt to knock the target prone while within 15 feet of it. The target must make a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.</p>\n<h3>Low Blow</h3>\n<p>You attempt to stun the target while within 15 feet of it. The target must make a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the start of its next turn.</p>\n<h3>Shank Shot</h3>\n<p>You attempt to hamper the target while within 15 feet of it. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. If it fails, it gains 1 slowed level and makes Dexterity saving throws with disadvantage until the end of its next turn.</p>",
