The target takes 8d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This power has no effect on undead or constructs.</p><p>If you target a plant creature or a magical plant, it makes the saving throw with disadvantage, and the power deals maximum damage to it.</p><p>If you target a nonmagical plant that isn't a creature, such as a tree or shrub, it doesn't make a saving throw, it simply withers and dies.</p><p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this power using a power slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.</p>",
