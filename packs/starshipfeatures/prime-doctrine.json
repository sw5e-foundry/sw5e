      "value": "<p>Also at 2nd tier, your starship strikes fear in your enemies. When crew members roll initiative, one crew member can attempt to frighten other ships. Each crew member deployed on a hostile ship must make a Wisdom saving throw contested by a Charisma (Menace) check. On a failed save, affected crew members have disadvantage on the first ability check, attack roll, or saving throw they make each round for 1 minute. At the end of each of their turns, they repeat this save, ending this effect on a success. Additionally, on a successful save, they become immune to this feature for one day.</p>\n<p>Once this feature has been used, it can't be used again until the ship recharges.</p>",
