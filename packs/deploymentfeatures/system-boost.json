      "value": "<p>Also at 1st rank, you learn techniques to quickly augment different systems on your ship that are fueled by special dice called tech dice.</p><h3>Techniques</h3><p>You learn two techniques of your choice, which are detailed under \"Techniques\" below. You can use only one technique per turn, and you can only use each technique once per round.</p><p>You learn an additional technique at 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th rank in this deployment. Each time you learn a new technique, you can also replace one technique you know with a different one.</p><h3>Tech Dice</h3><p>Your techniques are represented by your tech die, the starting size of which is a d4. Using your tech die does not expend it.</p><p>Your tech die changes when you reach certain ranks in this deployment. The die becomes a d6 at 2nd rank, a d8 at 3rd rank, a d10 at 4th rank, and a d12 at 5th rank.</p><h3>Creative Thinking</h3><p>If you roll a 1 on your tech die, it decreases by one die size until the end of your next turn. This represents you burning through your creativity. For example, if the die is a d6 and you roll a 1, it becomes a d4. If it's a d4 and you roll a 1, it becomes unusable until the end of your next turn.</p><p>Conversely, if you roll the maximum number on your tech die, it increases by one die size until the end of your next turn, up to a d12. This represents you having a creative break-through. For example, if you roll a 4 on a d4, the die then becomes a d6. If it's a d12 and you roll a 12, on future rolls until the end of your next turn, you can roll an extra die and choose which die to use.</p>",
