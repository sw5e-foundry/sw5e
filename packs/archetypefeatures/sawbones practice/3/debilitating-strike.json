      "value": "<p><em><strong>Sawbones Practice:</strong> 3rd level</em></p>\n<p>You learn to apply your anatomical knowledge in direct combat, in order to hinder your targets. When you deal Sneak Attack damage to a creature, you may choose to forgo two of your Sneak Attack Dice in order to hinder the creature, provided they have the appropiate physiology.</p>\n<p>Some of your debilitating strikes require your target to make a saving throw to resist the debilitating strike's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: </p>\n<p><em></em>_</p>\n<p><strong>Debilitating Strike save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<p><em></em>_</p>\n<h3>Bleeding Wound</h3>\n<p>You attempt to create a lingering wound in the target for one minute. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, at the start of each of the target's turns, it takes true damage equal to one Sneak Attack die and repeats this saving throw, ending the effect on a success. </p>\n<h3>Crippling Pain</h3>\n<p>You attempt to cause distracting pain in the target. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it has disadvantage on attack rolls until the end of your next turn. </p>\n<h3>Hampering Shot</h3>\n<p>You attempt to hamper the target's movement. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it gains 1 slowed level and it makes Dexterity saving throws with disadvantage until the end of its next turn.</p>",
