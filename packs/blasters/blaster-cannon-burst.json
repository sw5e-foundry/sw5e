      "value": "<h3>Auto</h3>\n<p>Weapons with this property can only fire in burst, penetrating, or rapid modes. If the weapon has any combination of burst, penetrating, and rapid modes, you choose which mode to use. You can only use one mode at a time.</p>\n<h3>Burst</h3>\n<p>When you would make a ranged weapon attack with a weapon with this property, you can instead spray a 10-foot-cube area within range with shots, consuming ammunition equal to the burst number. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your bonus to attacks with the weapon) or take the weapon's normal damage. Before you use this property, you can declare one creature that would be affected by it. If the creature fails its save, in addition to the weapon's normal damage, it is subjected to any additional effects that would occur on a hit. If you would have advantage on your attack roll, the creature instead has disadvantage on their saving throw, and if you would have disadvantage on your attack roll, the creature instead has advantage on their saving throw.</p>\n<h3>Rapid</h3>\n<p>When you would make a ranged weapon attack with a weapon with this property, you can instead unload on a single target, consuming ammunition equal to the rapid number. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your bonus to attacks with the weapon). On a failed save, roll the weapon's damage dice twice and add them together, adding relevant modifiers as normal and subjecting the target to any additional effects that would occur on a hit. If you would have advantage on your attack roll, the creature instead has disadvantage on their saving throw, and if you would have disadvantage on your attack roll, the creature instead has advantage on their saving throw.</p>\n<h3>Special (range 120/480)</h3>\n<p>A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has this property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.</p>\n<h3>Strength 19</h3>\n<p>A weapon with this property has a heavy kickback. While wielding it, you have disadvantage on attack rolls unless you meet the Strength requirement. If the weapon has the burst, penetrating, or rapid property, you must meet the Strength requirement to use this feature. If the weapon lacks the two-handed property, you can wield the weapon in two hands to temporarily reduce the strength number by one step (from 19 to 17, 17 to 15, 15 to 13, or 13 to 11). If this would reduce the strength number below 11, you ignore it entirely.</p>\n<h3>Two-handed</h3>\n<p>A weapon with this property requires two hands to use.</p>",
