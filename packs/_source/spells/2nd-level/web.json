The webs are difficult terrain and lightly obscure their area.</p>\n        <p>If the webs aren't anchored between two solid masses (such as walls or trees) or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling, the conjured web collapses on itself, and the power ends at the start of your next turn. Webs layered over a flat surface have a depth of 5 feet.</p>\n        <p>Each creature that starts its turn in the webs or that enters them during its turn must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is Restrained as long as it remains in the webs or until it breaks free.</p>\n        <p>A creature Restrained by the webs can use its action to make a Strength check against your power save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer Restrained.</p>\n        <p>The webs are flammable. Any 5-foot cube of webs exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing 2d4 fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire.</p>",
