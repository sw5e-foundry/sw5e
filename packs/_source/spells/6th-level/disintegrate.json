The target can be a creature, an object, or a creation of magical force, such as the wall created by wall of force.</p><p>A creature targeted by this power must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 10d6 + 40 force damage. The target is disintegrated if this damage leaves it with 0 hit points.</p><p>A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing and carrying, except magic items, are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. The creature can be restored to life only by means of a true resurrection or a wish power.</p><p>This power automatically disintegrates a Large or smaller nonmagical object or a creation of magical force. If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation of force, this power disintegrates a 10-foot-cube portion of it. A magic item is unaffected by this power.</p><p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this power using a power slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 3d6 for each slot level above 6th.</p>",
