A single flechette clip holds enough ammunition for three attacks in a short line or one attack in a long line. Each creature must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes [[/r 4d6]] ion damage on a failed save, or half as much as on a successful one. Any electronics within the blast radius that aren't being worn or carried are disabled until rebooted. If you lack proficiency in the wrist launcher, you must roll the damage dice twice and take the lesser total.</p>\n<p>Â </p>\n<h2>Flechette clip, ion</h2>\n<p>When triggered, this wrist launcher ammunition fires a volley of ion flechette rounds in a short line 15 feet long and 5 feet wide or a long line 45 feet long and 5 feet wide.
