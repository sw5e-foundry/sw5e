You gain proficiency in the Technology skill, as well as simple blasters. When you cast a force power that calls for a melee weapon attack, and you are wielding a blaster with which you are proficient, you can instead make a ranged weapon attack.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you've learned to manipulate the Force to be able to manipulate technology when it couldn't previously. When you cast a force power that could not affect droids or constructs, you can choose to have it affect droids or constructs. If it would affect multiple targets, you must expend additional uses of this feature for each additional target. You can use this feature twice. You gain an additional use at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.</p>",
