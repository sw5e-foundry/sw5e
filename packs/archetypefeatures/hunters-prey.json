When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, the creature takes an extra [[/r 1d8]] damage if it's below its hit point maximum. You can deal this extra damage only once per turn, and this damage is the same type as the weapon's damage. </p>\n<h3>Giant Killer</h3>\n<p>When a Large or larger creature within 5 feet of you hits or misses you with an attack, you can use your reaction to attack that creature immediately after its attack, provided that you can see the creature. </p>\n<h3>Horde Breaker</h3>\n<p>Once on each of your turns when you make a weapon attack, you can make another attack with the same weapon against a different creature that is within 5 feet of the original target and within range of your weapon, no action required.</p>",
