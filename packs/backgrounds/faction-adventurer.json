Due to the circumstances of how you were raised, you have been involved with wandering heroes for most of your life. Maybe you were part of an adventuring band previously, but split with them after a disagreement or tragedy. Or, perhaps you worked around heroes in a lesser role for most of your young life, and you are now ready to graduate to the front lines.</p>\n\t<p></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"background\">\n\t<p><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> Choose two from Athletics, Investigation, Nature, and Survival</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"background\">\n\t<p><strong>Tool Proficiencies:</strong> Your choice demolitions kit, security kit, or slicer's kit</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"background\">\n\t<p><strong>Languages:</strong> One of your choice</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"background\">\n\t<p><strong>Equipment:</strong> 50 feet of rope, a small knife, a trophy, a set of traveler's clothes, and a belt pouch containing 100 cr.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"background\"><h2>Feature: Faction Membership</h2></div>\n<div class=\"background\"><p>You are an established and respected member of an adventurer's faction, allowing you to rely on certain benefits that membership provides. If you are in a town with a headquarters for your adventurer's faction and you are in good standing with the faction, you will be allowed to look at the job postings and find adventuring work to earn money. \nfactions often wield tremendous political power. If you are accused of a crime, your faction will support you if a good case can be made for your innocence or the crime is justifiable. You can also gain access to powerful political figures through the faction, if you are a member in good standing. You must pay dues of 50 cr per month to the faction. Your dues must be current to remain in the faction's good graces.\n</p></div><h2>Background Feat</h2>\n<p>\n\tAs a further embodiment of the experience and training of your background, you can choose from the\n\tfollowing feats:\n</p>\n<div class=\"smalltable\">\n\t<p>\n\t\t</p><table><thead><tr><th>[[/r d8 # Feat]]</th><th>Feat</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class=\"rows\"><th>1</th><th>@Compendium[sw5e.feats.qSXmQGXxdYTfY7JP]{Brawny}</th></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><th>2</th><th>@Compendium[sw5e.feats.4O9ON0Km4QZ2ogZu]{Investigator}</th></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><th>3</th><th>@Compendium[sw5e.feats.OOTZcS7bWg0Ltaha]{Naturalist}</th></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><th>4</th><th>@Compendium[sw5e.feats.LzMxqm4eUJTrAcJQ]{Survivalist}</th></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><th>5</th><th>@Compendium[sw5e.feats.TonpRFhus7GQEe9u]{Specialist}</th></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><th>6</th><th>@Compendium[sw5e.feats.bqcghDqZHiXg1VqF]{Linguist}</th></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><th>7</th><th>@Compendium[sw5e.feats.xJ9X383Z2SHpFSio]{Alert}</th></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><th>8</th><th>@Compendium[sw5e.feats.wKpnpjOfwA7sF4WP]{Athlete}</th></tr></tbody></table>\n\t<p></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"background\"><h2>Suggested Characteristics</h2></div>\n<div class=\"medtable\">\n\t<p>\n\t\t</p><table><thead><tr><th>[[/r d8 # Personality Trait]]</th><th>Personality Trait</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class=\"rows\"><th>1</th><th>I can't bring myself to ignore a cry for help.</th></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><th>2</th><th>I hold onto every mildly interesting item I find, in case it comes in handy someday.</th></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><th>3</th><th>After all the weirdness I've seen on my travels, nothing can surprise me.</th></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><th>4</th><th>I spit and laugh in the face of danger.</th></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><th>5</th><th>Giving up is never an option for me.</th></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><th>6</th><th>I feel more at home in monster-infested dungeons than in civilized society.</th></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><th>7</th><th>I fill silence with wacky stories about my past misadventures, which may or may not be exaggerated.</th></tr><tr class=\"rows\"><th>8</th><th>My sense of humor is as dark and grim as the dungeons I explore.</th></tr></tbody></table>\n\t<p></p>\n</div>\n<p> </p><div class=\"medtable\">\n\t<p>\n\t\t</p><table><thead><tr><th>[[/r d6 # Ideal]]</th><th>Ideal</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class=\"rows\"><th>1</th><th>Adventure: All I want is to travel the world and see amazing things.
