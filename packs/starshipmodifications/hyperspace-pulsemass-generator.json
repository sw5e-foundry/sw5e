The field extends out to a distance of 150 feet around your ship for a number of rounds up to your ship's tier (minimum of one).</p><p>When you activate this feature, you can designate any number of ships you can see to be unaffected by it. An affected ship gains 1 Slowed Level while in the area, and when the ship enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + ship tier + the ship's Strength modifier). On a failed save, the ship takes 3d8 energy damage. On a successful save, the ship takes half as much damage.</p><p>The effects of this feature last until the beginning of your next turn unless the crewmember uses a bonus action to maintain it.</p><p>This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.</p>",
