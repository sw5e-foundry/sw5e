When opened, the door leads to a demiplane that appears to be an empty room 30 feet in each dimension, made of wood or stone. When the power ends, the door disappears, and any creatures or objects inside the demiplane remain trapped there, as the door also disappears from the other side.</p><p>Each time you cast this power, you can create a new demiplane, or have the shadowy door connect to a demiplane you created with a previous casting of this power. Additionally, if you know the nature and contents of a demiplane created by a casting of this power by another creature, you can have the shadowy door connect to its demiplane instead.</p>",
