Those that prey on the Empire are sometimes even held in high regard as bold warriors. However, you still have contacts within the criminal underworld and you're far closer than most people to the world of murder, theft, and violence that pervades the underbelly of civilization, and you have survived up to this point by flouting the rules and regulations of finer society.</p>\n\t<p></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"background\">\n\t<p><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> Choose two from Athletics, Deception, Intimidation, and Piloting</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"background\">\n\t<p><strong>Tool Proficiencies:</strong> One type of gaming set, your choice of demolitions kit, security kit, or slicer's kit</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"background\">\n\t<p><strong>Equipment:</strong> One set of traveler's clothes, a gaming set you are proficient with, poorly wrought maps of Outer Rim worlds in your territory, a small piece of jewelry worth 100 cr from some exotic planet, and a pouch containing 50 cr</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"background\"><h2>Feature: Galactic Scourge</h2></div>\n<div class=\"background\"><p>You've been from one end of the galaxy to the other.
