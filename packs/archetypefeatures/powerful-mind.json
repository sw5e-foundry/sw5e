      "value": "<p><em><strong>Way of the Seer:</strong> 6th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level</em></p>\n<p>You can use your force abilities to read a creature's thoughts. You can then use your access to the creature's mind to command it.</p>\n<p>As an action, choose one creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your universal force save DC. If the creature succeeds on the saving throw, you can't use this feature on it again until you finish a long rest. If the creature fails its save, you can read its surface thoughts (those foremost in its mind, reflecting its current emotions and what it is actively thinking about) when it is within 60 feet of you. This effect lasts for 1 minute. During that time, you can use your action to end this effect and cast the <em>coerce mind</em> force power at its base level on the creature without expending force points. The target automatically fails its saving throw against the power. </p>\n<p>You can use this feature three times. You gain an additional use at 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>",
