Choose Precise Reflection for Shien or Brutal Strikes for Djem So.</p>\n<h3>Precise Reflection</h3>\n<p>When you hit with an attack made by the <em>saber reflect</em> power, you can expend force points to deal additional damage to the target, which is the same type as the weapon's damage. The additional damage is [[/r 1d8]] for each point spent in this way. You can't deal more additional damage than the amount shown in the Focused Strikes column of the guardian table.</p>\n<h3>Brutal Strikes</h3>\n<p>The Force flowing through you grants you incredible strength. Your Force-Empowered Strikes and Improved Force-Empowered Strikes damage rolls gain a minimum roll threshold, discussed in chapter 7. Additionally, when you spend force points to use your Force-Empowered Strikes feature, you gain temporary hit points equal to twice the number of points spent.</p>",
