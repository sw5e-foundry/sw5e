      "value": "<p><em><strong>Warchief Approach:</strong> 14th level</em></p>\n<p>You have memorized the litanies, songs, and chants of your people and their dedication to war. When you enter a rage on your turn, you can enter a commanding rage for one minute. When you do so, during this turn and at the start of each of your turns, you have a number of special reactions equal to your proficiency bonus you can only use for your Commanding Rage feature. When you use Commanding Rage with these special reactions, they do not count against your uses of that feature. You can only use one reaction per turn. Additionally, during this rage, when an enemy within 10 feet of you makes an attack roll against an ally, you can use your reaction to reduce the attack by an amount equal to your Charisma modifier.</p>\n<p>Once you've used this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.</p>",
