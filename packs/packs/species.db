They are distinguished by two fleshy growths protruding from the sides of their heads, which they call lethorns. As they age, the lethorns thicken. Males also sport two horns growing from the top of their skulls. These were once used in underwater duels to attract a mate, and are seen as a sign of the males' strength and virility. Females lack the superior cranial horns, but had more pronounced and longer posterior head plates; these can reach halfway down their back. Chagrians also have very long black forked tongues.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>As a species, Chagrians are generally peaceful and law-abiding to the point of becoming stoic and obstinate. Many Chagrians are motivated only by basic desires such as sustenance, shelter, and healthcare. Chagrian government ensures that every citizen is cared and provided for, so the standard of living for the poorest Chagrian is high compared to the members of other species. Chagrians who expect violence often wear red.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Chagrian names have a very melodic tone. Male names are typically shorter than female names.

The ryn are a nomadic species, their original homeworld forgotten, even to them. They cannot abide confinement and constraint, and they itch to move on shortly after they arrive in a new place. Due to their homelessness, musical talent, natural secrecy, and avoidance of written records, ryn developed a nomadic culture and a reputation for confidence games, leaving many species prejudiced against them. In some sectors it is legal to enslave or hunt ryn. Their language is outlawed in many locations, and a large number of ryn women are used as slave breeding stock. They claim that sabaac, the popular card game that took the place of Pazaak in terms of card game prominence, is derived from their use of it as a fortune telling tool in their auguries. These auguries are today favored by hutts, who have a superstitious belief in the card tellings. A peculiar habit is that a ryn cannot sleep in the same location twice.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Ryn names have a very melodic tone, taking cues from many different languages from across the galaxy.

They also possess a very primitive nervous system, which provides them with immunity to most pain (a helpful trait in combat). Tognath begin life as larvae born from egg clutches hatched in a suspension jelly, and latch onto one of their parents, feeding directly from their bloodstream. While in that jelly, two or more eggs (not necessarily from the same parent) sometimes graft together, thus creating a bond that continues throughout the life of the eggmates.

The pyke homeworld serves as the headquarters of the Pyke Syndicate, a criminal dealership within the Spice Cartel that operates in the criminal underworld distributing spice, an illicit substance harvested by slaves in the spice mines of the planet Kessel. To deliver spice to their customers, such as crime families on Coruscant, the Pyke Syndicate relies on smugglers and freighter captains to complete the dangerous Kessel Run. The Pyke Syndicate almost completely controls the production of raw spice in the galaxy, while maintaining tentative alliances with other criminal organizations throughout the galaxy, such as the Black Sun and the Crimson Dawn. </p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Pyke names are often influenced by naming conventions of other species, with their rarely-used surnames being familial.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Dor, Eife, Qalo, Thok, Zret</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Gali, Taela, Shethni, Vent, Zeeren</p>\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> Kemtol, Nek, Pyke, Safet, Welkor </p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"EC","identifier":"pyke","advancement":[{"_id":"xCPiJKb7dm6L4Lxy","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.sw5e.speciesfeatures.9UEsYCuHud34lIYr","Compendium.sw5e.speciesfeatures.nHK4bFmsgVR1GPHA","Compendium.sw5e.speciesfeatures.6NagjaaP7eFm2Dky","Compendium.sw5e.speciesfeatures.wExFuDv31bzIVkIt","Compendium.sw5e.speciesfeatures.PMtfuPcy1Wo9ubaR","Compendium.sw5e.speciesfeatures.5ypgR5awoAM8TPwe","Compendium.sw5e.speciesfeatures.jDSyL0K6jG35g20g","Compendium.sw5e.speciesfeatures.JMqH5rokwgtRqqfj","Compendium.sw5e.speciesfeatures.6KMwCfmvB3bXaxuj","Compendium.sw5e.speciesfeatures.McdIsARyaf9nNSRy"],"optional":true},"value":{},"level":0,"title":"Traits","classRestriction":""}],"skinColorOptions":{"value":"Gray or green"},"hairColorOptions":{"value":"None"},"eyeColorOptions":{"value":"Blue, magenta, or purple"},"colorScheme":{"value":null},"distinctions":{"value":"Elongated, tapered skull with an undersized face"},"heightAverage":{"value":"5'2\""},"heightRollMod":{"value":"+2d10\""},"weightAverage":{"value":"100 lb."},"weightRollMod":{"value":"x(2d4) lb."},"homeworld":{"value":"Oba Diah"},"slanguage":{"value":"Pyke"}},"ownership":{"default":0,"fAkTu7iSmy0slLmX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"sw5e","systemVersion":"2.0.2.2.2.4","coreVersion":"10.288","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1667446282345,"lastModifiedBy":"MO2mq4AAHmz86wzy"}}

Their bodies also possess rapid healing abilities. These traits make them the perfect hand-to-hand specialists.</p>\n<p>The Cathar species also has two subspecies, known as the Juhani and the Myr Rho. Both of these are notably less catlike than mainline Cathar. Cathar are born into a litter. The Cathar species is biologically similar to the Bothan species.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>On their homeworld, Cathar live in cities built into giant trees, and are organized into clans governed by elders. Stories of their great heroes were often carved into the trunks of these tree-homes for following generations to see. The Cathar mate for life, to the extent that when one mate dies, the survivor never has a relationship with another. Cathar clan society includes great pageants and celebrations, especially for their heroes. Their religion includes a ritual known as the \"Blood Hunt,\" in which Cathar warriors individually engaged in combat against entire nests of Kiltik in order to gain honor and purge themselves of inner darkness. The native language of the Cathar is Catharese, which included the emphasis of some spoken words with a growl.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Cathar names can sound both melodic and fairly gutteral, but they almost always sound strong and fierce.

Ugnaughts live their lives in accordance to their \"blood profession\", with Ugnaught parents teaching their children their trade. Infant Ugnaughts are known as Ugletts. If the number of new Ugnaughts in a given profession exceeds the need, a blood duel is called. When the Ugnaughts reached their twentieth year of age, these fights are held to the death, with the victor winning the right to inherit their blood profession. Despite this outdated and violent custom, the Ugnaughts are generally a peaceful people with a rich culture.</p>\n<p>When greeting an Ugnaught, it is advised to bow silently, then wait for a guttural purring as a positive response. Usage of the common galactic greeting \"yaa-yaah\" is considered a personal insult to Ugnaughts. If this occurrs, it was advisable to duck and cover, as various mechanical implements will be thrown one's way. </p>\n<p>Ugnaughts are often enslaved as they are fairly meek.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Ugnaught names are generally concise.

The biggest visual difference between the two is that the kiffar always wear tattoos, that represent their clan. Kiffar are more likely to be Force-sensitive, which is typically manifested in psychometry, a rare Force power that about one percent of the kiffar population can use. Using psychometry, kiffar can touch objects and receive visions from the Force that show them the object—s past. </p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>The kiffar reside on the planets of Kiffu and Kiffex. Kiffar are a people who value their own independence, staying out of galactic affairs and being ruled only by themselves. They see outsiders as dangerous and are generally nationalists. They are organized into clans, and clan heritage is very important to them. Their markings, which they call qukuuf, are passed down through the family maternally, but kiffar with a human mother will typically use their father—s tattoos. Conversely, clan membership is passed down paternally, and those with a human father can join their mother—s clan. The traditional colors of the facial tattoos are red, yellow, and green. Various patterns and designs are used to identify the clan. </p>\n<p>Kiffu Guardians, also known as the Guardians of Kiffu, are an important kiffar institution that acts as a police force in their space. The Kiffu Guardians wear black armor, and they share a symbol with clan Vos, which is a gold five-pointed star outlined by a circle. </p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Kiffar use names similar to those of humans, varying drastically clan by clan.
