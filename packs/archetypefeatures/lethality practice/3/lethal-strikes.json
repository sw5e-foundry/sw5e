      "value": "<p><em><strong>Lethality Practice:</strong> 3rd level</em></p>\n<p>You learn how to read your foes and strikes their weak points. When you deal Sneak Attack damage to a creature, you may choose to forgo two of your Sneak Attack dice to make the attack a lethal strike. </p>\n<p>Some of your lethal strikes require your target to make a saving throw to resist the lethal strike's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: </p>\n<p><em></em>_</p>\n<p><strong>Lethal Strike save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier</p>\n<p><em></em>_</p>\n<h3>Priming Attack</h3>\n<p>You attempt to prime the target. The target must make a Dexterity, Constitution, or Wisdom saving throw (your choice). On a failed save, the next time you deal Sneak Attack damage against the target before the end of your next turn, you roll four additional Sneak Attack dice.</p>\n<h3>Target Assessment</h3>\n<p>You attempt to infer crucial details about your foe. The creature must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the GM tells you two of the following characteristics of your choice:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Highest ability score</li>\n<li>Lowest ability score</li>\n<li>Strongest saving throw</li>\n<li>Weakest saving throw</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Vulnerable Strike</h3>\n<p>You attempt to stagger the target. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the next time you would make an attack roll against the target before the end of your next turn, you can instead force the target to make a saving throw with the ability score of your choice. On a failed save, the creature takes normal weapon damage and you can apply your Sneak Attack dice to the roll.</p>",
