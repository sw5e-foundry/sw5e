      "value": "<p><em><strong>Teleportation Technique:</strong> 3rd, 5th, 9th, 13th, 17th, and 20th level</em></p>\n<p>You can use portable teleporters as a bonus action, instead of an action. </p>\n<p>Additionally, while you are wielding a tech focus, you can use your bonus action to create a pair of linked portals: one portal appears in a space within 5 feet of you, and the other portal appears in an unoccupied space you can see up to 30 feet away. These portals last until the start of your next turn, and they are large enough to accommodate Medium and smaller creatures and objects. Portals take the appearance of an elongated, shimmering mirror, and looking through a portal, a creature can see through the linked portal as if looking through a window. A creature or object who passes through a portal immediately appears in a space within 5 feet of the linked portal. You can use your reaction to end your portals early. If a creature is partially within your portals, it is shunted back to the space it previously occupied and it must make a Dexterity saving throw against your a tech save DC. On a failed save, it takes energy damage equal to your scout level + your Intelligence modifier. You can use this feature twice. You gain an additional use at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest. At the beginning of each of your turns while you have a pair of portals active, you can expend a use of this feature to extend the duration of the portals until the start of your next turn (no action required). The distance at which you can create portals increases at higher levels. It increases to 60 feet at 5th level, 90 feet at 9th level, 150 feet at 13th level, 300 feet at 17th level, and 1,000 feet at 20th level.</p>",
