      "value": "<p><em><strong>Way of Suggestion:</strong> 18th level</em></p>\n<p>You've learned how to weave the Force around you in a cloak of your choice. As an action, you can focus the Force for 10 minutes. For the duration, you gain your choice of one of the following effects.</p>\n<p>You can use each feature once. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.</p>\n<h3>Cloak of Fright</h3>\n<p>Each creature of your choice that is within 60 feet must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your universal force save DC or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p>\n<h3>Cloak of Invisibility</h3>\n<p>You and everything you are wearing or carrying become invisible to creatures of your choice. If you damage a creature or affect it with a force power, it can make a Wisdom saving throw against your universal force save DC. On a success, you are no longer invisible to that creature.</p>\n<h3>Cloak of Memory</h3>\n<p>Creatures that see you or any allies within 30 feet of you during this time cannot recall your physical appearances, your mannerisms, or any other identifying features.</p>\n<p>Creatures that interact with you must make a Wisdom saving throw against your universal force save DC once the interaction ends. You can choose to exclude a creature from this effect. On a failed save, the creature forgets all details of the interaction, rationalizing any of its outcomes.</p>",
