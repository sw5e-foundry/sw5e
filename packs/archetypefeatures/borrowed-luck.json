      "value": "<p><em><strong>Gambler Pursuit:</strong> 17th level</em></p>\n<p>You have gained the ability to unnaturally alter luck in your favor. Once per round, after an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check is rolled by you or a creature that you can see, you can replace the number on the [[/r d20]] with a 7. Note the number on the [[/r d20]] of the roll that you replaced. That number becomes your borrowed luck roll.</p>\n<p>While you have a borrowed luck roll, you can expend it and replace any ability check, attack roll, or saving throw made by you or a creature that you can see with the value of the borrowed luck roll. You can only have one borrowed luck roll at a time, and you lose any </p>\n<p>unused borrowed luck rolls when you complete a short or long rest.</p>",
