      "value": "<p><em><strong>Brawling Approach:</strong> 3rd level</em></p>\n<p>While you are raging, not wearing heavy armor, and not wielding a shield, when you hit a creature with an unarmed strike or improvised weapon, you can choose to forgo your rage damage to make the attack a reckless strike.</p>\n<p>Some of your reckless strikes require your target to make a saving throw to resist the reckless strike's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>\n<p><em></em>_</p>\n<p><strong>Reckless Strike save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier</p>\n<p><em></em>_</p>\n<p>You can use these features a combined number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, as shown in the berserker table. You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest.</p>\n<h3>Bracing Strike</h3>\n<p>You gain temporary hit points equal to your rage damage bonus. If the target is grappled by you, you instead gain temporary hit points equal to twice your rage damage bonus.</p>\n<h3>Punishing Strike</h3>\n<p>Your target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is deafened until the start of its next turn. If the target is grappled by you, it is instead incapacitated until the start of its next turn.</p>\n<h3>Staggering Strike</h3>\n<p>Your target must make a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (the target chooses the ability score to use). On a failed save, your target is pushed back 5 feet. If the target is grappled by you, it is instead knocked prone.</p>",
